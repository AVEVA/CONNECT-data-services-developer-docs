# Assign roles to groups

When a role is assigned to a group, all the users in that group will see the AVEVA Data Hub tile on their home page in AVEVA Connect. You assign a user or group to a role based on the actions they need to perform in AVEVA Data Hub. 

To assign a group to roles, perform the following steps:

1.	From the AVEVA Connect home page, click the menu icon, then select **User Management**.

1. Select the **Groups** tab. 

    The existing groups are listed.

1. Select the required group to which you want to assign roles.

1. Select the **Roles** tab. The list of existing roles assigned to the group is displayed.

    **Note:** You can search for the required group by typing a few letters in the **Filter by group name** field.

1. Select **Assign role** to assign more roles to the group. 

  The `Assign role` area is displayed.
 
1. Select the type of role:

  - `Service role` - to assign a functional role to the group.

  - `Account role` - to assign an administrative role (giving users and/or groups access to administer your AVEVA Connect account). 

1. If you selected `Service role`, select the required service and folder from the **Service** and **Folder** lists.

1. Select the role to assign from the **Role** list.

1. Select the groups to assign this role. You can select multiple groups at once. You can search for the group names by typing a few letters in the **Enter group name(s)** field.

   **Note:** You must assign the role to at least one group or user.

1. Select **Save** to save these changes. 

    The role is assigned to the selected groups.
