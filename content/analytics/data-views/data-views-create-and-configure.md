# Create and configure a data view

This is an introduction to the recommended workflow for creating and defining data views. 

## Before you start

Review the following information before creating a data view.

### Prerequisites

- To create a fully functioning data view, your instance of OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) must include [streams](xref:ccStreams) or [assets](xref:ccAssets) to include in the data view.

- If you want to include streams from a community within your data view, you must be a member of that community.
