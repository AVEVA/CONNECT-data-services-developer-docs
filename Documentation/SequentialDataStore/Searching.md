Searching
=====================
Search in SDS provides a way to search text, fields, etc. across the Sequential Data Store. This document covers the 
searching for SdsStreams, SdsTypes, and SdsStreamViews.

Searching for Streams
=====================

The search functionality for streams is exposed through the REST API and the client libraries method ``GetStreamsAsync``.
The searchable properties are below. 

| Property          | Searchable  |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Id                | Yes		  |
| TypeId            | Yes		  |
| Name              | Yes		  |
| Description       | Yes		  |
| Indexes           | No		  |
| InterpolationMode | No		  |
| ExtrapolationMode | No		  |
| PropertyOverrides | No		  |
| [Tags](xref:sdsStreamExtra)*		| Yes		  |
| [Metadata](xref:sdsStreamExtra)*	| Yes		  |

``GetStreamsAsync`` is an overloaded method that is used to search for and return streams (also see [Streams](xref:sdsStreams) for information about using ``GetStreamAsync`` to return streams). When you call an overloaded method, the software determines the most appropriate method to use by comparing the argument types specified in the call to the method definition.

The syntax of the client libraries method is as follows:
```csharp
      _metadataService.GetStreamsAsync(query:"QueryString", skip:0, count:100);
```

Searching for streams is also possible using the REST API and specifying the optional `query` parameter, as shown here:
 ```text
      GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query={query}&skip={skip}&count={count}
 ```

The Stream fields valid for search are identified in the fields table located on the [Streams](xref:sdsStreams) page. Note that Stream Metadata has unique 
syntax rules, see [How Searching Works: Stream Metadata](#Stream_Metadata_search_topic).

Searching for Types
=====================

Similarly, the search functionality for types is also exposed through REST API and the client libraries method ``GetTypesAsync``. The query syntax and the request parameters are the same. 
The only difference is the resource you're searching on, and you can search on different properties for types than for streams. The searchable properties are below. 
See [Types](xref:sdsTypes) for more information.

| Property          | Searchable |
|-------------------|------------|
| Id                | Yes        |
| Name              | Yes        |
| Description       | Yes        |
| SdsTypeCode       | No         |
| InterpolationMode | No         |
| ExtrapolationMode | No         |
| Properties        | Yes, with limitations |


``GetTypesAsync`` is an overloaded method that is used to search for and return types. 

The syntax of the client libraries method is as follows:
```csharp
      _metadataService.GetTypesAsync(query:"QueryString", skip:0, count:100);
```

As previously mentioned, searching for types is also possible using the REST API and specifying the optional `query` parameter, as shown here:
 ```text
      GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Types?query={query}&skip={skip}&count={count}
 ```

The Type fields valid for search are identified in the fields table located on the [Types](xref:sdsTypes) page. The Properties field is identified
as being searchable but with limitations: Each SdsTypeProperty of a given SdsType has its Name and Id included in the Properties field. This includes nested
SdsTypes of the given SdsType. Therefore, the searching of Properties will distinguish SdsTypes by their respective lists of relevant SdsTypeProperty Ids and Names.

Searching for Stream Views
=====================

Similarly, the search functionality for stream views is also exposed through REST API and the client libraries method ``GetStreamViewsAsync``. The query syntax and the request parameters are the same. 
The only difference is the resource you're searching on, and you can match on different properties for stream views than for streams and types. 
The searchable properties are below. See [Stream Views](xref:sdsStreamViews) for more information.

| Property     | Searchable |
|--------------|------------|
| Id           | Yes		|
| Name         | Yes		|
| Description  | Yes		|
| SourceTypeId | Yes		|
| TargetTypeId | Yes		|
| Properties   | Yes, with limitations |


``GetStreamViewsAsync`` is an overloaded method that is used to search for and return stream views. 

The syntax of the client libraries method is as follows:
```csharp
    _metadataService.GetStreamViewsAsync(query:"QueryString", skip:0, count:100);
```

As previously mentioned, searching for stream views is also possible using the REST API and specifying the optional `query` parameter, as shown here:
 ```text
    GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/StreamViews?query={query}&skip={skip}&count={count}
 ```
The Stream View fields valid for search are identified in the fields table located on the [Stream Views](xref:sdsStreamViews) page. The Properties field
is identified as being searchable but with limitations because SdsStreamViewProperty objects are not searchable. Only the SdsStreamViewProperty's
SdsStreamView is searchable by its Id, SourceTypeId, and TargetTypeId, which are used to return the top level SdsStreamView object when searching. 
This includes nested SdsStreamViewProperties.

How Searching Works
=====================

The ``GetStreamsAsync``, ``GetTypesAsync``, and ``GetStreamViewsAsync`` overloads return items that match specific 
search criteria within a given namespace. 
The query parameter will be applied across all searchable fields of objects we’re searching on by default.

For example, assume that a namespace contains the following Streams:

**streamId** | **Name**  | **Description**
------------ | --------- | ----------------
stream1      | tempA     | The temperature from DeviceA
stream2      | pressureA | The pressure from DeviceA
stream3      | calcA     | calculation from DeviceA values


Using the stream data above, the following table shows the results of a ``GetStreamsAsync`` call with different ``Query`` values:

**QueryString**     | **Streams returned**
------------------  | ----------------------------------------
``temperature``  | Only stream1 returned.
``calc*``        | Only stream3 returned.
``DeviceA*``     | All three streams returned.
``humidity*``    | No streams returned.

The ``skip`` and ``count`` parameters determine which items are returned when a large number of them match 
the ``query`` criteria.   

``count`` indicates the maximum number of items returned by the ``GetStreamsAsync()`` or ``GetTypesAsync()`` call. The maximum value of 
the ``count`` parameter is 1000. 

``skip`` indicates the number of matched items to skip over before returning matching items. You use the 
skip parameter when more items match the search criteria than can be returned in a single call. 

**.NET Library**

For example, assume there are 175 streams that match the search criteria: “temperature”.

The following call returns the first 100 matches:
```csharp
    _metadataService.GetStreamsAsync("temperature", 0, 100)
```

After the previous call, you can use the following call to return the remaining 75 matches, skipping over the first 
100 matches because of the skip parameter set at 100):
```csharp
    _metadataService.GetStreamsAsync("temperature", 100, 100)
```

The ``orderby`` parameter is supported for searching both the streams and types. The basic functionality of it is to search the items and then return the result in sorted order.
The default value for ``orderby`` parameter is ascending order. It can be changed to descending order by specifying ``desc`` alongside the orderby field value. It can be used in conjunction with 
``query``, ``skip``, and ``count`` parameters.

**Request**
 ```text
	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=name:pump name:pressure&orderby=name

	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=name:pump name:pressure&orderby=id asc

	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=name:pump name:pressure&orderby=name desc

	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=name:pump name:pressure&orderby=name desc&skip=10&count=20
 ```

Tokenization
=====================

Tokenization is the process of breaking a string sequence into pieces called tokens using specific characters to delimit tokens. 

When performing a search, the user specified query is tokenized into search terms. 

The rules around how the query string is tokenized can affect the search results. 
Terms are delimited by spaces or by one or more punctuation characters followed by a space. 

Punctuation follwed by other characters without space does not trigger tokenization and is treated
as part of the term. 

If your query has a wildcard after trailing punctuation, neither is tokenized. To specifically search on a term that has trailing punctuation, enclose it in quotation marks 
to ensure the punctuation is part of the query. See examples below:

 Term | Tokenized Term
----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
``Device.1`` | ``Device.1``
``Device!!1`` | ``Device!!1``
``Device. ``  | ``Device``
``Device!!`` | ``Device``
``Device!*`` | ``Device``
``"Device!"*`` | ``Device!``


Search operators
=====================

You can specify search operators in the ``query`` string to return more specific search results. 

Operators | Description
----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
``AND`` | AND operator. For example, ``cat AND dog`` searches for streams containing both "cat" and "dog".  AND must be in all caps.
``OR``  | OR operator. For example, ``cat OR dog`` searches for streams containing either "cat" or "dog" or both.  OR must be in all caps.
``NOT`` | NOT operator. For example, ``cat NOT dog`` searches for streams that have the "cat" term or do not have "dog".  NOT must be in all caps.
``*``   | Wildcard operator. This matches 0 or more characters in a word.  For example, ``log*`` searches for streams that have a term that starts with "log" (e.g. "log", "logs" or "logger"), ignoring case.
``:``   | Field-scoped query.  This specifies a particular field to search on.  For example, ``id:stream*`` will search for streams where the ``id`` field starts with "stream", but will not search on other fields like ``name`` or ``description``.
``" "`` | Quote operator. This searches on an exact sequence of characters rather than searching on words separated by spaces or punctuation.  For example, while ``dog food`` (without quotes) searches for streams containing "dog" or "food" anywhere in any order, ``"dog food"`` (with quotes) will only match streams that contain the whole string together and in that order.
``( )`` | Precedence operator. For example, ``motel AND (wifi OR luxury)`` searches for streams containing "motel" and either "wifi" and/or "luxury".

**: Operator**
---------------

You can also qualify which fields are searched by using the following syntax: 

	fieldname:fieldvalue

**Request**
 ```text
	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=name:pump name:pressure
 ```

**.NET Library**
```csharp
	GetStreamsAsync(query:”name:pump name:pressure”);
```

**\* Operator**
-----------------

You can use the ``'*'`` character as a wildcard to specify an incomplete string. A wildcard can only be used once for each search term, except for the case of a Contains type query clause. In that case two wildcards are allowed - one at the beginning and one at the end of the term.  For example, ``*Tank*`` is valid but ``*Ta*nk``, ``Ta*nk*``, and ``*Ta*nk*`` are currently not supported.

**Query string**     | **Matches field value** | **Does not match field value**
------------------ | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------
``log*`` | log<br>logger | analog
``*log`` | analog<br>alog | logg
``*log*`` | analog<br>alogger | lop
``l*g`` | log<br>logg | lake swimming

**Supported**     | **Not Supported**
------------------ | ----------------------------------------
``*``<br>``*log``<br>``l*g``<br>``log*``<br>``*log*`` <br>``"my log"*``	| ``*l*g*``<br>``*l*g``<br>``l*g*`` <br>``"my"*"log"``

**Request**
 ```text
	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=log*
 ```

**.NET Library**
```csharp
	GetStreamsAsync(query:”log*”);
```

\"" Operator	
-------------------	

The search engine automatically searches on strings delimited by whitespace and punctuation.  To search for values that include these delimiters, enclose the value in double quotes.	

When using double quotes, the matching string must include the whole value of the field on the object being searched.  Partial strings will not be matched unless wildcards are used.  For example, if you're searching on a stream that has a description of ``Pump three on unit five``, a query of ``"unit five"`` will not match the description, but a query of ``*"unit five"`` will.

Also, wildcards can be used on the *outside* of the quote operators, but if an asterisk is on the inside of the quotes, it is treated as a string literal rather than a wildcard operator.  For example, you can search for ``"dog food"*`` to find a string that starts with "dog food", but if you search for ``"dog food*"``, it will only match on a value of "dog food*".

 **Query string**     | **Matches field value** | **Does not match field value**	
------------------ | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------	
``"pump pressure"`` | pump pressure | pressure <br> pressure pump <br> pump pressure gauge	
``"pump pressure"*`` | pump pressure <br> pump pressure gauge | pressure <br> pressure pump <br> the pump pressure gauge
``*"pump pressure"`` | pump pressure <br> the pump pressure | pressure <br> pressure pump <br> the pump pressure gauge
``*"pump pressure"*`` | pump pressure <br> pump pressure gauge <br> the pump pressure gauge | pressure <br> pressure pump 
``"pump*pressure"`` | pump\*pressure | pump pressure <br> the pump pressure gauge

 **Request**	
 ```text	
	GET api/v1-preview/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=”pump pressure”	
 ```	

 **.NET Library**	
```csharp	
	GetStreamsAsync(query:“\\“pump pressure\\””);	
```	


Other operators examples
---------------------

**Query string**     | **Matches field value** | **Does not match field value**
------------------ | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------
``mud AND log`` | log mud<br>mud log | mud<br>log
``mud OR log`` | log mud<br>mud<br>log | 
``mud AND (NOT log)`` | mud | mud log
``mud AND (log OR pump*)`` | mud log<br>mud pumps | mud bath
``name:stream* AND (description:pressure OR description:pump)`` | The name starts with "stream" and the description has the either of the terms "pressure" or "pump" | 


## <a name="Stream_Metadata_search_topic">How Searching Works: Stream Metadata</a>

[Stream Metadata](xref:sdsStreamExtra) modifies the aforementioned search syntax rules and each operator's behavior is described below. 
For example, assume that a namespace contains the following Streams and the respective Metadata Key-Value pair(s) for each stream.

**streamId** | **Metadata**
------------ | --------- 
stream1      | { manufacturer, company }<br>{ serial, abc }
stream2      | { serial, a1 }
stream3      | { status, active }<br>{ second key, second value }   
 

: Operator
-------------------
A Stream Metadata key is only searchable in association with a Stream Metadata value. This pairing is defined using the same  field scoping ``':'`` operator. 

	myStreamMetadataKey:streamMetadataValue

If the ``':'`` operator is not used within an individual search clause then Metadata Keys are not searched against but Metadata 
Values are searched against (along with the other searchable Stream fields).

**QueryString**     | **Streams returned**
------------------  | ----------------------------------------
``manufacturer:company``  | Only stream1 returned.
``company``  | Only stream1 returned.
``a*``  | All three streams returned.

**Request**
 ```text
	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=manufacturer:company
 ```

**.NET Library**
```csharp
	GetStreamsAsync(query:"manufacturer:company");
```

\* Operator
-------------------

For searching on Metadata values the ``'*'`` character is again used as a wildcard to specify an incomplete string. Additionally,
this wildcard character can be used with the Metadata key as well. This is not supported for any other "fields", so by including a wildcard in a field
(defined as a value to the immediate left of a ``':'`` operator) the query will only be valid against Stream Metadata.

**QueryString**     | **Streams returned**
------------------  | ----------------------------------------
``manufa*turer:compan*``  | Only stream1 returned.
``ser*al:a*``  | Stream1 and stream2 are returned.
``s*:a*``  | All three streams returned.
``Id:stream*``  |  All three streams returned.
``Id*:stream*``  | Nothing returned.

Note that in the final example nothing matches on a Stream's Id value because including ``'*'`` in a search clause's 
field prevents non-Stream Metadata fields from being searched.

**Request**
 ```text
	GET api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=manufa*turer:compan*
 ```

**.NET Library**
```csharp
	GetStreamsAsync(query:"manufa*turer:compan*");
```
