# Data sharing

After you are added as a Community Member, you can use the Sequential Data Store to view data streams that other tenants have shared with the community. Additionally, if you are assigned a tenant role with the **Share** permissions for data streams, you can share streams from your tenant with the community. Users who can share streams within a community are also called *data stewards*.
 
## Prerequisites for data sharing

To share data with a community, your user role must be assigned the **Share** permissions for data streams. For more information, see <xref:manage-streams>.

## Data sharing tasks

Community data sharing actions include:

- <xref:ShareStreams>

	Share a data stream with the community or unshare one.

- <xref:view-community-data>

	View which streams are shared within a community, or view the stream data that another tenant has shared.
