# Workflow to create community

Complete the following procedures to create a new community and invite other tenants to join it.

**Tip:** Looking for instructions on how to join a community? See <xref:community-accept-invite>.

## Prerequisites to create a community

To create a new community, you must:

- Be a [Tenant Administrator](xref:ccRoles#tenant-roles).

- Have the email address for Tenant Administrator of the tenant that you invite to the community.

## Community creation outline

Complete the following procedures to start a new community and invite other tenants.

- <xref:add-community>

	This procedure provides instruction on how to create a new community on any tenant. During this process, you name the community, choose which roles can administer it, and choose which users from your tenant can participate.

- <xref:community-invite>

	This procedure provides instruction on how to invite other tenants to join your community. After sending an invitation, wait for the invited tenant to accept it. Once the invited tenant accepts, you can confirm the tenant's participation.

	**Note:** You can be a user assigned a role with [community administration](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) permissions rather than a Tenant Administrator to complete this procedure.

- <xref:community-manage-sds-permissions-create>

	Manage permissions for data streams to allow Community Members from your tenant to share streams with the community.
