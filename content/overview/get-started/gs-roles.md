# Get started with roles

Use roles to manage access to assets, resources, and services in AVEVA Data Hub. Assign roles to identities, which include users, groups, and client-credentials clients. See the following topics for more information about roles:

- [Roles](xref:ccRoles)

- [Roles best practices](xref:ccRoles#roles-bp)

To create a role, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Roles**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Role**.

1. In the `Add Role` window, complete the following fields:

   - **Name**  - Enter *MyData.Role*.


   - **Description** - (Optional) Add a description for this role.

   
1. To create the new role, select **Add**. 

    It is added to the table of Roles. Note that the Role Type for all custom roles is `Tenant Custom`. You can now specify permissions for this role when managing permissions on assets, resources, and services. 
    
    **Note:** By default, the new role will not have any access granted or denied.
    
1. Select the `MyData.Role` role and select **Manage Identities**.

1. In the `Manage identities for MyData.Role Role` window, select the **Add Identity** dropdown list. 

    The list displays all users and clients in the tenant. Select **+** to add any users or clients in the list to the role.

1. When you are finished, select **Save**.
