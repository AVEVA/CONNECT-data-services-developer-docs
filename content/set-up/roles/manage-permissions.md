# Manage role permissions

As an administrator, you manage user access to AVEVA Data Hub resources by specifying what actions members of a role can take. You can grant or deny a role access to read, write and/or delete data, as well as manage permissions.

To manage role permissions, follow these steps:

1. Open the AVEVA Data Hub portal.
 
   **Note:** Resource creators have complete access to all resources.   

1. Select the **Manage Permissions** ![](../images/manage-permissions.png) button in the upper-right toolbar.

   The `Manage Permissions` window opens.

1. Select the **Selected Role** field, then choose a role from the dropdown list. 

1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Allow** option next to the actions you want the role to be able to perform.
 
1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Deny** option next to the actions you do not want the role to perform.

1. After assigning permissions to the role, select **Save**.
