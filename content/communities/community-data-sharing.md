# Data sharing

After a community is established, users assigned the Share permission for the Sequential Data Store can share data streams with a community and tenants. Additionally, Community Members can view which data streams their tenant has shared or view which streams another tenant has shared.  

## Data sharing tasks

Community data sharing actions include:

- <xref:ShareStreams>

	Share a data stream with the community or unshare one.

- <xref:community-view-shared-streams>

	View which streams you or another tenant has shared within a community.

- <xref:community-view-shared-data>

	View the data from a stream that another tenant has shared in a community.
