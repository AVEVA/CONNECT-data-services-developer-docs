# Sign in to AVEVA™ Data Hub 

This topic explains how to navigate to AVEVA™ Data Hub via [AVEVA™ Connect](https://connect.aveva.com/) for the following types of accounts:

* Corporate sign-in: federation for single sign-on
* Single user sign-in
* Third-party user access

## Corporate sign-in: federation for single sign-on

Some AVEVA™ Connect accounts use Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which enables authentication and authorization to AVEVA™ Connect applications using the corporate user identity. This enables you to use single sign-on with the user account from the corporate domain.

1. Open the [AVEVA™ Connect page](https://connect.aveva.com/). 

   **Note:** If single sign-on is enabled, you only need to provide your email address when signing in to AVEVA™ Connect. You may be prompted to sign into your corporate Sign-In page.

1. From the AVEVA™ Connect home page, click on the folder that represents your organization's services.
   
   **Result:** The available applications for this namespace account appear. 
     
1. Click on the tile that represents AVEVA™ Data Hub.

   **Result:** The AVEVA™ Data Hub portal opens.

    **Result:** The AVEVA™ Connect home page is displayed.

    **Note:** If you attempt a sign-in ten times consecutively with a wrong password from the same location (IP address), then your login will be blocked. If this happens, contact AVEVA™ Global Customer Support to unlock your account.
