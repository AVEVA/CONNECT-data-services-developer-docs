# Accept community invitation

If another tenant invites you to a community, you will receive an email from the inviting tenant. Follow the instructions in the email to accept the invitation to the community.

## Prerequisites for accepting community invitations

- Your user account must be assigned the tenant administrator role.

- You must have an email invitation. If you have not received one, contact the inviting community administrator and request a new invitation. 

## To accept a community invitation

To accept an invitation, follow these steps:

1. Open the email from OSIsoft Cloud Services, read the instructions, and select the VIEW COMMUNITY INVITE link.

1. If prompted, enter the tenant ID or tenant alias for your tenant and select **Continue**.

1. On the authentication window, verify your identity.

  A page opens and displays that your tenant will join the community that issued the invitation. Membership in the community does not begin until the inviter confirms the invitation.

1. Select **Join**.

  The inviter receives an email asking for confirmation of the pending invitation.

1. Assign community membership to tenant users. These users will be able to choose data streams to share with the community.

    In the list of users, select **Add User** ![Add User](images\add-button-white-background.png "Add User") beside each user who should be a community member. If necessary, you can filter the list of users by typing in the **Filter by name or e-mail** field.

    **Note:** If you do not assign yourself the Community Administrator role, you cannot access details about the new community unless you use the [Users](xref:ccUsers) feature to assign yourself the `new_community_name` Community Member Role.
