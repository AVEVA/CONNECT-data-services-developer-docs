## Visualize shared data

After a stream is shared within a community, any [Community Member](xref:community-community-roles#community-member) can visualize it within the `Trend` page as if it were a data stream from their own tenant. For more information on how to visualize data from a community within a trending session, see <xref:CreateTrendSession>.
