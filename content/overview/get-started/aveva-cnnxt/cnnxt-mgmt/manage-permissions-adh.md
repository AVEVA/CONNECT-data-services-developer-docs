# Manage permissions in AVEVA Connect

Permissions are managed in both AVEVA Connect and AVEVA Data Hub. As an AVEVA Data Hub administrator, you begin in AVEVA Connect by creating groups, adding users via email address, and assigning roles. Once these tasks are completed, you can add and then map existing users or groups to AVEVA Data Hub roles. See [Manage users and permissions in AVEVA Data Hub](xref:lpsetupADH).
