# Community administration

After a community is established, the community administrator from each tenant can perform administrative actions to integrate new tenants and users in the community. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites for community administration

To perform most tasks related to community administration, you must have [community administration](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) permissions assigned to your user role.

**Note:** Some community administration tasks require you to be a [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview) rather than a community administrator. These tasks are denoted below with an asterisk (*).

## Community administration tasks

Community administrative actions include:

- <xref:community-remove-tenants>

	Remove tenants from a community. 

- <xref:community-resend-invitation>

	If you invite a tenant to the community but they do not receive it, you can resend the invitation.
