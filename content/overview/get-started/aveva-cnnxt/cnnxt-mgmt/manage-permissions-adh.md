# Manage permissions in AVEVA Connect

Permissions are managed in both AVEVA Connect and AVEVA Data Hub. As an AVEVA Data Hub administrator, you begin setting up permissions in AVEVA Connect by creating groups, adding users by their email address, and assigning roles. Once these tasks are completed, you can add and map users or groups that already exist to an AVEVA Data Hub role. 

From within the AVEVA Data Hub portal, you can also add groups, users, roles, and clients. See [Manage users and permissions in AVEVA Data Hub](xref:lpsetupADH).
