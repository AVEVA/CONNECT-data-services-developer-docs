# Community setup

Establish a community by creating it and then inviting other tenants owned by business partners. Each invitation is a three-way handshake. A Tenant Administrator from the establishing tenant sends an email invitation to one or more tenant administrators from another tenant. The business partner then accepts the invitation. The original tenant administrator who issued the invitation confirms it, allowing the partner to join the community.
