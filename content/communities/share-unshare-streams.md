# Share and unshare streams

Use these procedures to share or stop sharing streams of data with other communities. To share streams, they must already be defined.

**Note:** To share or unshare a stream, your role must have the Manage Permission privilege for that stream. By default any user who creates a stream has the Manage Permission privilege. To manage permissions for a role, use the **Sequential Data Store** > **Streams** feature.

## Share streams

You can share streams with other tenants from the **Sequential Data Store** page. Choose the streams that you want to share and the communities that you want to share them with. 

To share streams with other communities, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. If it is not already selected, select **Streams** at the upper left.

1. Select each stream that you want to share, and then select **Share Streams**.

    **Tips:** 
    * Use the **Search for streams** field to search for specific streams. Use the wildcard operator (`*`) to return results that start or end with a particular phrase. For more information, see [Search in SDS](xref:sdsSearching).
    * When sharing a large numbers of streams, edit the **Items per page** dropdown to a value that accommodates the number of streams that you want to share.

1. Select one or more community to share your streams with.

1. Select **Select Communities**.

1. From the list of communities, select the communities with which you want to share streams and select **Continue**. 

    **Tip:** Use the **Filter Communities** field to find a specific community.
    
1. To confirm that you want to share the streams with the chosen communities, select **Share**. From the **Share stream** window, select **Confirm**. Then select **Close**.

**Result:** The chosen streams are shared with the chosen communities. All members of the selected communities are able to read data from the shared streams.

## View shared data

After you or another community member shares a stream within a community, you can visualize it within a chart from the `Trend` page. For more information on how to visualize data from a community within a trending sessions, see <xref:CreateTrendSession>.

## Unshare streams from Community Details

To stop sharing streams, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community where you are sharing streams and select **Details**.

1. On the `Community Details` page, select the **Tenants** tab.

1. Select your own tenant.

   **Result:** A pane opens on the right.

1. On the **Streams** tab, select the streams you want to stop sharing, then select **Unshare Streams**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Unshare**.

**Result:** The streams are unshared from the community. Other tenants in the community can no longer view them.

## Unshare streams from the Sequential Data Store
