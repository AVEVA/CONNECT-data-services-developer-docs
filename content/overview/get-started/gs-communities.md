# Get started: Communities

Communities allow a tenant to create a private group where operational data can be shared and viewed across other tenants. Using communities, industrial companies can share their data streams externally with trusted business partners, service providers, and analytics providers.

To join a community, follow the applicable scenario below. Regardless of which scenario you follow, reviewing the following document is recommended:
