# Community administration

After a community is established, the community administrator from each tenant can perform administrative actions to integrate new tenants and users in the community. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites

To perform most tasks related to community administration, you must have [community administrator permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) assigned to your user role.

**Note:** Some community administration tasks require you to be a [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview). These tasks are denoted below with an asterisk (*).
