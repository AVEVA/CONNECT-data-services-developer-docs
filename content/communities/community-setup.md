# Community setup

Establish a community by creating it and then inviting your trusted business partners to join from their tenant. Each invitation is a three-way handshake. The [Tenant Administrator](xref:ccRoles#tenant-roles) that established the community, also known as the [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview), sends an email invitation to a Tenant Administrator from another tenant. The trusted business partner then accepts the invitation. The original Tenant Administrator who issued the invitation confirms it, allowing the trusted partner to join the community. After confirmation, users from the newly confirmed tenant can view data from other community tenants or share data streams from their own tenant with the community.
