# Overview of PI to OCS

The PI to OCS lighthouse release enables you to transfer both on-prem PI data and AF data to OCS. Transferring PI System data allows your organization to have data available wherever you go, so you can connect with the best in-class analytics, and with your community of vendors, service providers, and business partners. PI to OCS includes the following features:

* Transfer of a selection of Data Archive PI points from PI servers to OCS Sequential Data Store (SDS) [streams](xref:sdsStreams).

* AF elements and attributes are transferred as assets and metadata and properties.

* Simultaneous transfer of both historical and streaming data from Data Archive to SDS for a selection of PI points.

* Configuration of a PI points and assets selection and data transfer management from the portal

PI to OCS has the following components:

- *PI to OCS Agent* - an on-premises component that serves as a bridge between the data source(s) and the OCS destination. The agent runs as a service and performs fast, secure data transfers.

- A cloud component - resides within OCS and receives data from the on-premises PI to OCS Agent and stores it in SDS.

The deployment of a PI to OCS Agent establishes a one-to-one connection from an on-premises Data Archive and optional AF server to an OCS namespace. 

The following diagram shows a deployment of PI to OCS Agents that transfer data to OCS.
