# Add an asset based on an asset type

An asset type is a template for creating assets that share a common structure or type. When you create an asset based on an asset type, the metadata and stream references are created from the asset type.

To create an asset based on an asset type:

1. In the left pane, select **Visualization** > **Asset Explorer**.

1. From the **Asset/Asset Types** selector, select **Assets**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Asset**. 

1. In the `Select Type for New Asset` window, select the type and select **Continue**.

1. In the right pane, complete the following fields:

   - **Asset** - Enter a name to identify the asset.

   - **Asset Type** - Displays the asset type on which this asset is based.

   - **Description** - (Optional) Add a description for the asset. 

1. Select the **Metadata** tab. 

1. If needed, edit the values the metadata.

    **Note:** You can only edit the values. The metadata are derived from the asset type, as indicated by the **T** and, therefore, you cannot add or delete metadata or change the type.

1. Select the **Properties** tab.

1. To see the stream reference configuration details, select the caret ![](../../../_icons/default/chevron-up.svg) icon. 

1. To save the asset, select **Save**.
