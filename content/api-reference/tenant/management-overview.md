# Tenant management

The Tenant Management API allows users to create, manage, and administer tenants by assigning users, roles, and namespaces to their tenants. Through the API, users can manage access control that is used in the CONNECT data services infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the tenant management features. Administration functionality is also available from the CONNECT data services portal.
