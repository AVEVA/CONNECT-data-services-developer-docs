# Store data

You can use the Sequential Data Store (SDS) to store, retrieve, and organize any type of streaming data. 

SDS types define the structure of data to be collected in OCS. A type is analogous to a template that defines each instance in a stream of data.

SDS stream data comprises values or events of the same SDS type and is ordered (indexed) by one or more properties defined by the stream's SDS type, usually a timestamp.
