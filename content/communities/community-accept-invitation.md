# Accept community invitation

To accept an invitation, follow these steps:

1. Open the email from OSIsoft Cloud Services, read the instructions, and select the VIEW COMMUNITY INVITE link.

1. If prompted, enter the tenant ID or tenant alias of the tenant from which you want to share data and select **Continue**. You must be a Tenant Administrator to accept the invitation.

1. On the authentication window, verify your identity.

  A page opens and displays that your tenant will join the community that issued the invitation. Membership in the community does not begin until the inviter confirms the invitation in the next step.

1. Select **Join**.

  The inviter receives an email asking for confirmation of the pending invitation.

1. Assign community membership to tenant users.

    In the list of users, select **Add User** ![Add User](images\add-button-white-background.png "Add User") beside each user who should be a community member. If necessary, you can filter the list of users by typing in the **Filter by name or e-mail** field.

    **Note:** If you do not assign yourself the Community Administrator role, you cannot access details about the new community unless you use the [Users](xref:ccUsers) feature to assign yourself the `new_community_name` Community Member Role.
