# View service status

AVEVA™ maintains the following real-time status dashboard, where you can get updates on the status and system health of its cloud offerings: https://status.connect.aveva.com/.

AVEVA™ uses this dashboard to publish notifications for scheduled maintenance updates to solutions, and if there are any interruptions to service, provides an initial status along with regular updates until the service returns to normal. You can subscribe to relevant alerts to be notified of postings as they are made.
