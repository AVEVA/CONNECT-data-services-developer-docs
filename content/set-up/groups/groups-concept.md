# AVEVA Data Hub groups

Groups allow you to assign and manage roles for groups of users.
	
You must create groups in the identity provider, AVEVA Connect. Users are assigned to groups within AVEVA Connect as well. After they are created in AVEVA Connect, you can add groups within AVEVA Data Hub and assign roles to them.
