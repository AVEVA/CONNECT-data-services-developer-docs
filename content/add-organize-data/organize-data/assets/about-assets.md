# Organize steams with assets

An asset is a container for data streams associated with a particular device or object. When you create an asset, you scope it to a namespace and a set of streams within that namespace. Assets typically represent devices with multiple data streams; however, you can create an asset with only one stream if needed. 

Use the asset explorer in the OCS Portal to create assets and visualize selected data streams and properties for troubleshooting and analysis of the associated devices or entities. You can create assets on an ad hoc basis or create them from an asset type, which acts as a template for creating similar assets.

For more information on assets, see [Assets](xref:WhatOCSdoes#assets).
