# Step 2C: Add Users to a Group

As a best practice, AVEVA recommends assigning users to groups so that they can be managed as a single object in AVEVA Data Hub. Add the users that you created in <xref:invite-users> to the appropriate groups that you created in <xref:assign-users>.

To add users to a group:

1. From the AVEVA Connect home page, select ![menu](../../../../../_icons/default/menu.svg) > **User Management**.

1. Select the **Groups** tab.

1. Select the group that you want to add users to.

   You can search for the required group by typing in the **Filter by group name** field.

1. Select **Add users** to add users to the group.

1. Enter the usernames of the users you want to add to this group. You can add multiple users at a time.

1. After you have added the required users, select **Save**.
