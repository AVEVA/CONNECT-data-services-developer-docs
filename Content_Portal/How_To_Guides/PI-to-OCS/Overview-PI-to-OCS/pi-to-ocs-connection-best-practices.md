# PI System connections best practices

Only one PI to OCS Agent per connection is allowed to transfer data from a specific PI Data Archive to an OCS namespace. This restriction prevents multiple PI to OCS Agents from pulling data from a single PI Data Archive, which can create an excessive load on the server. The following recommendations address this issue:

- Install the PI to OCS Agent on a host computer that is separate from your PI Data Archive deployment, so it does not add to the load on the host computer.
- Keep the PI to OCS Agent software version up to date for the best performance. The OCS Portal indicates when an agent is out of date and needs to be updated.
