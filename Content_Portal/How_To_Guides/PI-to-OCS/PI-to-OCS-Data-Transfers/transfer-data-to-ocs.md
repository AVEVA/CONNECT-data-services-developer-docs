# Transfer PI System data to OCS

After PI points have been added to a data transfer, you are ready to stream your PI system data into OCS. Before data is transferred, the SDS streams are created.  Then, both the historical and most current data is transferred to OCS simultaneously. You can view PI points selected for the transfer before or during the data transfer.

## Procedure

1. In the **Data Transfer** section of the **Details** pane, click **View**.

    **Result:** The **Transfer Configuration** window opens and display the PI points selected for the data transfer.

2. **Optional:** To filter PI points by a string of characters, enter the first few characters of the PI point name in the **Filter PI Points** text box.

    **Tip:** The **Filter PI Points** text box is not case sensitive.

**Note:** Any PI points that canâ€™t be transferred are listed at the bottom of the **Transfer Configuration** window. There are several reasons a PI point ID might not be resolved and included in a data transfer, such as an out-of-date Agent, security issues or removed PI points.

3. **Optional:** Close the **Transfer Configuration** window.
4. To initiate the data transfer, click **Start** in the **Data Transfer** section of the **Details** pane.
5. Click **Start** again to confirm.
**Result:** The **Status** field changes to **Stopped** (**Starting**) in the **Data Transfer** section.
6. **Optional:** To stop the data transfer at any time, click **Stop**.

**Note:** The **Data Transfer** section provides details on the streaming status of a data transfer. Since it reports on how much historical data has been transferred for a given time period, the rate of progress varies depending on the density of data in the PI Data Archive.
