# Overview of AVEVA™ Connect

AVEVA™ Connect (https://connect.aveva.com/) is the common cloud platform on which AVEVA™ Data Hub sits. AVEVA™ Connect helps to organize your organization's projects and you use it to subscribe and manage access to services, such as AVEVA Data Hub.

Before you configure AVEVA™ Connect to work with AVEVA™ Data Hub, it is important to understand how solutions, folders, and permissions work.

### What is a solution?

A solution is the product that AVEVA™ makes available to customers. AVEVA™ Data Hub solutions are reflected as folders in AVEVA™ Connect. You can enable multiple applications and capabilities in AVEVA™ Connect on a folder where data is shared with multiple applications; for example, AVEVA™ Insight.

### What are folders used for?

Folders in AVEVA™ Connect are used to partition data. They work analogously to folders in a traditional tree explorer. Many AVEVA™ products use projects to model the same concept. Folders represent your assets, but they can refer to any partition of data.

### How are permissions managed?

This content will be added once permissions have been sorted out in Connect & ADH. On the Connect side, users are added to groups before they can access a service. On the ADH side, permissions can be controlled by assigning groups to the built-in Data Hub roles (Tenant Admin, Tenant Contributor, etc.). 

<!--V.Touati, 10/21/21: TBD per F. Scott. Talk about where permissions are managed here. Are they managed in DataHub and duplicated in Connect, or are permissions managed in Connect and just mirrored in DataHub?-->

Please refer to the [AVEVA™ Connect User Documentation](https://help.connect.aveva.com/#/index/10/11) for more information.
