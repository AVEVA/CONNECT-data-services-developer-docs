Data Ingress and OSIsoft Message Format
=======================================

You use OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) to achieve high-throughput asynchronous data ingress 
into the Sequential Data Store. The following terms are useful for understanding the information
in this and subsequent sections:

* A producer of OMF messages needs a *Client* identity to authenticate and send messages.
* Messages are sent to a queue called a *Topic*. 
* A *Subscription* receives messages from a Topic and writes them to the Sequential Data Store.
