# Manage tenants in a community

Use the `Community Details` page to manage tenants that already belong to a community. This page also lets you add tenants to a community.

To create a new community, see [Add a community](xref:add-community).

## Invite a tenant to a community

Invite business partners to join a community so they can share data. 

**Note:** The business partner must already belong to a tenant in OCS.

Two different users must perform the following procedure to invite and add a tenant to a community:

- One user, the "inviter," invites another tenant. To be an inviter, you must be a Community Administrator.

- Another user, the "invitee," accepts the invitation on behalf of their tenant. To be an invitee, you must be a Tenant Administrator of a separate tenant that does not already belong to the community.

## Step 1: Inviter sends invite

To send an invite to a community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Open the email from OSIsoft Cloud Services Operations, read the instructions, and select the VIEW COMMUNITY INVITE link.

1. If prompted, enter the tenant ID or tenant alias of the tenant from which you want to share data and select **Continue**. You must be a Tenant Administrator to accept the invitation.

1. On the authentication window, verify your identity.

  A page opens and displays that your tenant will join the community that issued the the invitation. Membership in the community does not begin until the inviter confirms the invitation in the next step.

1. Select **Join**.

  The inviter receives an email asking for confirmation of the pending invitation.

1. Assign community membership to tenant users.

    In the list of users, select **Add User** ![Add User](images\add-button-white-background.png "Add User") beside each user who should be a community member. If necessary, you can filter the list of users by typing in the **Filter by name or e-mail** field.

    **Note:** If you do not assign yourself the Community Administrator role, you cannot access details about the new community unless you use the [Users](xref:ccUsers) feature to assign yourself the `new_community_name` Community Member Role.

## Step 3. Inviter confirms invite

To confirm an invite, follow these steps:

1. Follow the instructions in the email.

1. Log into the tenant that owns the community you are sharing.

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. On the `Communities` overview page, find the community to which you have invited another tenant and select **Details**.

1. On the `Community Details` page, select the **Invitations** tab.

1. Select an invitation with a status of **Invitation Accepted**.

1. On the `Invitation Details` pane, select **Confirm Tenant**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Confirm Tenant** again.

  The invitee's tenant is now part of the community.
