# Add users to a community

The `Community Details` page lets you add users from your tenant as [Community Members](xref:ccRoles#community-member-role-preview). You can only add users from your own tenant. Each tenant manages its own community membership.

When you add a user to the community, they are assigned the Community Member role, which lets them view both the community and the data streams shared by other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites

To add users as Community Members, you must be assigned [community administrator permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview).

## To add members to a community

To add users from your own tenant to a community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community where you want to add users and select **Details**.

1. On the **My Members** tab, select **Add User**.

1. Select tenant users for membership. All If necessary, you can filter the list of users by typing in the **Filter users** field.

1. Select **Save**.

Each user is added to the community and assigned the Community Member role.
