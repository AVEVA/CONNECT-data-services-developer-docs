# Step 2: Set up AVEVA Connect users and groups

AVEVA Data Hub users and groups are managed through AVEVA Connect. You must first add users and groups in AVEVA Connect before those users can access AVEVA Data Hub. These steps guide you through creation of users and groups in AVEVA Connect. Later, in <xref:gs-setup-data-hub-users>, you will add these users and groups to AVEVA Data Hub.

**Step 2A: Add Users**

Add the users that will use AVEVA Data Hub to AVEVA Connect. For instructions on completing this process, see <xref:invite-users>.

**Step 2B: Add Groups**

AVEVA recommends managing users as groups, so you should create one or more groups to organize your users. For instructions, see <xref:create-group>.

**Step 2C: Add Users to a Group**

Place your users in the appropriate groups. For instructions, see <xref:assign-users>.

**Step 2D: Assign Groups the Data Hub Viewer Role**

Before you or any other user can log into Data Hub from Connect, you must first assign your user group the **DataHub Viewer** role in Connect. This role allows users to see the service tile within Connect that allows you to log into AVEVA Data Hub. For instructions, see <xref:assign-roles-groups>.
