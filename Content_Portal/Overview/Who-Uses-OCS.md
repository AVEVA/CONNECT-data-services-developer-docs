# Who uses OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) and what do they use it for?  

OCS extends the data infrastructure seamlessly by integrating existing OSIsoft products and third-party vendors from edge to cloud. This enables data to be shared across the entire infrastructure, reaching new data users such as developers creating custom applications, data scientists engaged in predictive data modeling, operations staff who monitor real-time performance, and data analysts using visualized data. OCS enables this diverse group of users to access the data they need to perform their tasks. 

It is increasingly important that data is accurate so that the insights produced from it are accurate for the entire enterprise. OCS extends the data infrastructure, producing a single reliable source of truth and providing a common starting point for all applications. 

Extending the collection and accessibility of the operational data allows new analysis and decision-making processes to benefit the company. Who are the users of this data and how do they use it to help in the decision-making for their business? 

## Data Scientists use OCS for Data Models to Gain Business Insight 

Data scientists can easily integrate operational data from multiple sources into predictive modeling. Better data modeling enables smart decision-making leading to clear answers to what is most relevant to the companyâ€™s goals. OCS uses the entire data infrastructure to gather the right type of data for modeling tools that answer business questions such as maintenance and demand forecasting. 

OCS enables this process by: 

- Allowing the operations department and data scientists to share data and collaborate more effectively 
- Providing an environment where the data modeling process is documented using OCS data, ensuring that the analysis and results are replicable, and the results are valid 

- Ensuring that high quality data is available for modeling 

### How does OCS enable data scientists? 

#### Data is easier to find

Curating and preparing data is the most time-consuming part of the work for data scientists creating their predictive models. Time-aligned data, bad data, and data gaps decrease the accuracy of any results. In contrast, data that is contextualized, shaped, filtered for relevancy, and in a format that is compatible for modeling tools and applications increases the efficiency of the data scientist and accuracy of the results. 

#### More data is available to users 

OCS removes the challenges of complicated and overbuilt data solutions (data lakes, relational databases) and provides a direct option for extending the data infrastructure. OCS data can be consumed by almost all software applications that data scientists use to perform their analysis because it is compatible with all R and PYTHON applications. 

#### Data is prepared for data science modeling 

Data Views pre-shape and preconfigure OCS data to be compatible with specific tools or applications. They add context to the data for easy identification and classification, and operational data can be organized in tabular form so that it can be queried with REST APIs. Data views preconfigure data sets for algorithm and modeling tool consumption. 

#### Data modeling is flexible 

Data scientists need to experiment with and update their predictive models. The REST API gives data scientists this flexibility to work with different data modeling tools and applications now and as the data science technology evolves. 

#### Data is contextualized to enable data scientists to choose the right data

Data science predictive models are only as good as the data used in the models. Identifying the data that is relevant is as important as the model itself. OCS uses metadata rules to provide the context that makes it easy to search for and find data. OCS metadata rules parse and store data that match specific patterns and search incoming data for patterns and attach metadata to those data. 

#### APIs integrate operational data with applications

OCS supports easy integration with custom applications, extending the enterprise data infrastructure further to in-house and partner applications. 

## Operations Departments use OCS to Monitor Performance and Events in Real Time for Remote Locations 

OCS provides the ability to integrate the data infrastructure from edge to cloud seamlessly. It is designed to serve as a "System of systems" to support data usage across the global enterprise. This seamless integration of the data infrastructure offers the following benefits: 

- Confidence that data across the entire spectrum is authoritative: sensors in devices, assets, plant operations, enterprise, community (multiple enterprises) 
- Data is compatible and native to the infrastructure across the spectrum 
- OT data can be accessed and used anywhere; it is no longer isolated in one facility or system 
- New sources of operational data are available by storing the data in the cloud 
- Integration of existing edge and PI System data 

As a result of these benefits, OCS provides the ability to monitor remote operations in locations that operate quite differently than traditional plant environments.
