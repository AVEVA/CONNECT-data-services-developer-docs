# Create a community

When you create a community, you define a space where external partners share operational data with one another. The community is private; no one outside of your community has access.

When you create a community, you can designate a [Community Administrator](xref:communityroles#community-administrator).

For information about adding or deleting tenants from an existing community, see [Manage tenants in a community](xref:managecommunity).

**Note:** Only a [Tenant Administrator](xref:communityroles#tenant-administrator) can perform this procedure.

1. On the navigation bar, click **Communities**.

2. On the `Communities` page, click **Add Community**.

3. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the new community and click **Next**.

    A dialog opens that allows you to assign a Community Administrator from your tenant.

4. Click **Add User**.

    A list of users appears.

5. Click **Add User** ![Add User](images\add-button-white-background.png "Add User") beside each user who should be an Community Administrator. If necessary, you can filter the list of users by typing in the **Filter by name or e-mail** box.

    **Note:** If you do not assign yourself the Community Administrator role, you cannot access details about the new community unless you use the OCS [Users](xref:ccUsers) feature to assign yourself the _new_community_name_ Community Member Role.

6. Click **Create**.

    The community is added to the `Communities` page.
