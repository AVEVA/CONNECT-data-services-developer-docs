# View community data 

After a community has been established and one or more tenant has shared a data stream within it, any tenant and its community members can view that shared data. You can access shared data streams one of two ways: the **Community details** page or the **Sequential Data Store** page.

## To view community data from Community details

You can view data streams shared by each tenant within a community by browsing to its **Community Details** page, choosing a community, and viewing its **Streams** tab.

1. From the left panel, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

    **Result:** The **Communities** page opens, listing a card for each community.

1. Browse to the community that you want to view stream data for and click **Details**.

    **Tip:** Use the **Filter Communities** field to quickly find a community.

    **Result:** The **Community details** page opens for the community.

1. From the **Tenants** tab, select the community tenant that you want to view data for.

    **Result:** Details for the community open in the right pane.

1. From the right pane, select the **Streams** tab.

**Result:** The **Streams** tab lists each data stream that the tenant is sharing with the community. To see more details about each stream, select a stream and then click the **launch** icon ![launch icon](images/launch_black_18dp.svg). 

## To view community data from Sequential Data Store

When viewing streams from the **Sequential Data Store** page, you can view each stream and review whether it is shared within a community. Additionally, you can use the **Filter Communities** panel to filter the streams shared within one or more community.

1. From the left panel, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Optional: Toggle the **Filter Communities** panel by clicking the **filter** icon ![filter icon](images/filter_alt_black_18dp.svg) and select a community to filter for.

    Filtering the page by communities displays only streams that are shared within the selected communities.

1. Select a stream.

**Result:** Additional details about the stream display in each tab of the right panel, including **Details**, **Metadata and Tags**, and **Sharing**. If the selected stream is not shared within any community, the **Sharing** tab is unavailable.
