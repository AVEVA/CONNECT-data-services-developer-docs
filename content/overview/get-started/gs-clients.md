# Get started with clients

Clients provide a way for users or applications to authenticate against AVEVA Data Hub from applications other than the portal. AVEVA Data Hub supports different client types, each of which support different types of applications:

- Client-credentials clients – used for server-to-server communication where no user interaction is required.

- Authorization code clients – used with customer web applications that use AVEVA Data Hub as their backend.

- Hybrid clients – used by native and server-side web applications.

You can start with any of the clients and progress to the other two.
