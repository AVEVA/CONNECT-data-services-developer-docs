# Share streams

Users with permissions to share a data stream within a [community](xref:communities) can do so from the Sequential Data Store. 

- For more information on sharing a stream with a community, see [Share streams](xref:community-manage-shared-streams#share-streams).

- For more information on unsharing a data stream with a community, see [Unshare streams](xref:community-manage-shared-streams#unshare-streams).
