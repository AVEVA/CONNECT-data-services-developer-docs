# Asset Types API

The asset type API provides methods to create, read, update, and delete asset types. An asset type can be used to build many similar assets. Some of the key benefits of using an asset type as the base model for assets are:

- Multiple similar assets can be created more quickly and with less effort.
- Maintaining assets is simplified.

When updating an asset type which is referenced by assets, the following behaviors may apply:
- Deleting a metadata value on the asset type removes the metadata value on the resolved asset of any referenced asset​s.
- Renaming a metadata value on the asset type renames the metadata value on the resolved asset of any referenced assets​.
- Renaming the stream reference name on the asset type renames the stream reference on the resolved asset of any referenced assets.

PUT api/v1-preview/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/AssetTypes/{assetTypeId} 
```
