# Edit event

You can edit the values for any existing event.

1. Select the stream to edit an event for and choose **View Data**.

    **Tip:** Use <xref:Search> to find your stream.

1. Edit **Query Type** and its options to display the event that you want to edit.

    For more information on editing the query type, see [Edit query type](xref:streams-view-data#edit-query-type).

1. Choose the event that you want to edit and select the **Edit** ![edit](../../../_icons/default/pencil.svg) icon.

1. Enter or select a value for each data type value.

    For enumerated data types, values map to the friendly name rather than an integer.

1. Select **Save**.

The stream event is edited.
