# Account Management

The Account Management API allows users to create, manage, and administer OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) accounts by assigning users, roles, and namespaces to their tenants. Through the API, users can manage access control that is used in the OCS infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the Account Management features. Administration functionality is also available from the OCS portal.
