# Community administration

After a community is established, the community administrator from each tenant can perform administrative actions to integrate new tenants and users in the community. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites for community administration

To perform most tasks related to community administration, you must have [community administration](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) permissions assigned to your user role.

**Note:** Tasks denoted with a <sup>1</sup> require you to be a [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview) rather than a community administrator.
