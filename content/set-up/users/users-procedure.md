# Add a user

A user is an identity that has access to an OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) tenant. Roles assigned to a user determine what permissions the user has on resources in OCS. See the following for more information about users:

- [PI Server counterpart](xref:ccUsers#users-pi-server)
- [Users best practices](xref:ccUsers#users-bp)

## Procedure

Follow the procedure to invite a user to your tenant.

1. Click the ![Menu icon](../images/menu-icon.png) icon and click **Users** (under Security).

1. In the toolbar, click **Add User**.

1. If multiple identity providers are enabled in your tenant, you are prompted to select an identity provider. Choose the appropriate identity provider for the user you are adding. After you select an option, you can later switch to a different option.

1. Enter a first and last name for the user.  

1. Enter the contact email. The invitation to your OCS tenant is sent to the user at this address. Ensure that it is correct so that the invitation is not sent to an unintended recipient.

1. (Optional) Enable additional roles for the user. By default, the user is assigned the Tenant Member role which cannot be removed. Roles can be modified after the user is invited.

1. Once the information has been entered, click **Invite**. OCS sends the invitation to the email address specified in the `Contact Email` field. The **Status** column lists the new user as *Pending* until the invitation is accepted. If the invitation expires, the status changes to *Expired*. Once expired, the invitation can be resent.

1. Once the user receives the invitation, they should log in using the identity provider you specified. Once they have logged in, the status of their user changes to *Active*.
