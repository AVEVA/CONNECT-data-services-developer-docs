# Get started: Communities

Communities allow a tenant to create a private group where operational data can be shared and viewed across other tenants. Using communities, industrial companies can share their data streams externally with trusted business partners, service providers, and analytics providers.

- **Seamless Data Sharing**: Facilitate easy and secure data exchange among engineering and operational partners.

- **Enhance Operational Efficiency**: Collaboratively streamline operations and minimize waste through shared operations data.

- **Uncover Hidden Issues**: Detect and troubleshoot equipment and process problems with insights from your partners' operational data and expertise.

- **Proactive Failure Prediction**: Predict and prevent future failures by leveraging collective data intelligence.

To create or join a community, follow the applicable scenario listed in the headings below. Regardless of which scenario you follow, reviewing the following documentation on communities is recommended:
