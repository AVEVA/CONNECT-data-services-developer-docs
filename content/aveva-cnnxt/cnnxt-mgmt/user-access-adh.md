# Overview of user and access management in AVEVA™ Connect

As an Administrator, you set up users and control access to AVEVA™ Data Hub in AVEVA™ Connect. The following initial set up tasks must be performed in AVEVA™ Connect before users can access and use AVEVA™ services:

- Create new users for an account

- Create new groups

- Assign users to groups

- Assign capability permissions to groups

When a capability role is assigned to a group, all users of that group will be able to see the appropriate capability launch tile on their home page in AVEVA™ Connect.

**Question for AVEVA™ Connect SME reviewer:** Should admin tasks be performed in the order they appear in the Connect User Guide? ((1) Add users, (2) add groups, (3) create folders, (4) assign roles, and (5) assign users to groups)
