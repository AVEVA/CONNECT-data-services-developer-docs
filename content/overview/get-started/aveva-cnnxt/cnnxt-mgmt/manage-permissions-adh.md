# Manage permissions in AVEVA Connect

Permissions are managed in both AVEVA Connect and AVEVA Data Hub. As a Data Hub administrator, begin setting up permissions in Connect by creating groups, adding users, and assigning roles. Once these tasks are completed, you can map a group or user to a Data Hub role. 

From within the AVEVA Data Hub portal, you can also add groups, users, roles, and clients. See [Manage users and permissions in AVEVA Data Hub](xref:lpsetupADH).
