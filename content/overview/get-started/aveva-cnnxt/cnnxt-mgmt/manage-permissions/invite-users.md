# Step 2A

As an administrator, you set up new users in AVEVA Connect. When a new user is added and assigned to a role, an email is sent to the user with an invitation to access AVEVA Connect.

To set up new users:

1. From the AVEVA Connect home page, select ![menu](../../../../../_icons/default/menu.svg) > **User Management**.

1. Make sure the **Users** tab is selected.

1. Select **Add user**.

1. In the **Username** field, enter the user's email address.

1. Skip the **Groups** and **Add individual role** controls for now. You will add users to groups and apply roles to them in future steps.

1. Select **Save**.

   The user is created and an email invitation to AVEVA Connect is sent to the user's email address.
