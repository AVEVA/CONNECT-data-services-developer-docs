# OSIsoft Message Format (OMF)

You can use OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) for programmatic access to data. OMF defines a set of message headers and bodies you can use to transfer data to OSIsoft Cloud Services. Because it does not depend on a particular protocol, such as HTTP, you can use OMF to develop data-acquisition applications on platforms and in languages for which there are no supported OSIsoft libraries.  Using OMF, you can integrate data collection directly into a device or asset.  

<!-- Angela Flores 6/9/21 - This sentence is in direct conflict with the OMF guide: Because it does not depend on a particular protocol, such as HTTP, you can use OMF to develop data-acquisition applications on platforms and in languages for which there are no supported OSIsoft libraries. OMF can use any programming language, but requires an HTTP client. -->
