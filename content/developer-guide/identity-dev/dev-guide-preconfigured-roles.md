# Roles

OSIsoft provides two preconfigured roles:

- Tenant Member
- Tenant Administrator

## Tenant member

Tenant Member is assigned to every user and Client Credential Client. Users and Clients issued with this role can generally access information pertaining to themselves.

## Tenant administrator

This is the highest privilege role, with the ability to create new and remove existing users, clients and secrets. OSIsoft advises against assigning this role to Client Credential Clients.
