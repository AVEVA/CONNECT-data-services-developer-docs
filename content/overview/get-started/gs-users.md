# Get started with users

A user is an identity that has access to a tenant. Roles assigned to a user determine what permissions the user has on resources. For more information about users, see [Users](xref:ccUsers).

To invite a user to your tenant, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Users**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add User**.

    <!--VTT, 12/14/21: There is only one identity provider now - AVEVA Connect. Per N. Parakh, delete all references to identity providers.  This step is no longer valid in UI. "3. If multiple identity providers are enabled in your tenant, you are prompted to select an identity provider. Choose the appropriate identity provider for the user you are adding. After you select an option, you can later switch to a different option."-->

1. In the **Contact First Name** and **Contact Last Name** fields, enter a first and last name for the user.  

1. In the **Contact Email** field, enter the contact email. The invitation is sent to the user at this email address. Ensure that the email address is correct so that the invitation is not sent to an unintended recipient.

1. (Optional) Enable additional roles for the user. By default, the user is assigned the Tenant Member role which cannot be removed. Roles can be modified after the user is invited.

1. Select **Invite**. 

   An invitation is sent to the email address specified in the `Contact Email` field. The **Status** column lists the new user as *Pending* until the invitation is accepted. If the invitation expires, the status changes to *Expired*. Once expired, the invitation can be resent.

1. When the user receives the invitation, the user should log in using AVEVA Connect. Once the user has logged in, the user status changes to *Active*.
