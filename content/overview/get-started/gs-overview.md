# Get started with AVEVA Data Hub

This section introduces the main features of AVEVA Data Hub. Each section includes a tutorial with step-by-step procedures and links to basic concepts and best practices.

## Before you begin

Before you begin the get started exercises, obtain the following:

- Request a tenant from your AVEVA account manager.
- Have a designated folder that is connected to a namespace created prior to beginning these exercises. 
- You must have Tenant Administrator privileges in AVEVA Data Hub. 

## Log into AVEVA Connect and navigate to the AVEVA Data Hub portal

Once you have completed the pre-requisites, log into AVEVA Connect.

**Note:** These browsers are supported for the most recent three versions, unless otherwise stated: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. 

Open the [AVEVA Connect page](https://connect.aveva.com/). 

   **Note:** If single sign-on is enabled, you only need to provide your email address when signing in to AVEVA Connect. You may be prompted to sign into your corporate Sign-In page.

1. From the AVEVA Connect home page, select the folder that represents your organization's services.
   
   **Result:** The applications available from this namespace account are displayed below the folder. 
     
1. Select the tile that represents AVEVA Data Hub.

   **Result:** The AVEVA Data Hub portal opens.

## AVEVA Data Hub portal

The AVEVA Data Hub portal is a web-based application through which you can perform many tasks. Alternatively, you can accomplish the same tasks through the AVEVA Data Hub REST-based API. This introduction to AVEVA Data Hub uses the portal functionality. Before you start the exercises, see [Take a tour of the AVEVA Data Hub portal](xref:introPortalInterface) to get an overview of the user interface.

## Get started goals

In these get started exercises, you will do the following:

1. Create two connection types, one that brings in Data Archive data and another that brings in data using an OMF application.

1. Create a type that defines the data you want to store.

1. Create a stream container to store that data.

1. Create clients for different types of applications.

1. Invite a user to your tenant.

1. Create a role that defines permissions for users.

**Note:** Each exercise is built upon the previous one; therefore, complete the exercises in the order shown. At the end of each exercise, you will be directed to the next exercise.
