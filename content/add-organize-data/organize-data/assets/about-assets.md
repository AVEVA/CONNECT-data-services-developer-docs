# Organize streams with assets

An asset is a container for data streams associated with a particular device or object. When you create an asset, you select a namespace and a set of streams within that namespace. Assets typically represent devices with multiple data streams; but, you can create an asset with only one stream if needed.

Use Asset Explorer in the portal to create assets, then visualize data streams and properties to troubleshoot and analyze the associated devices. You can create assets as needed or create them from an asset type, which acts as a template for creating similar assets.

For more information on assets, see [Assets](xref:WhatOCSdoes#assets).
