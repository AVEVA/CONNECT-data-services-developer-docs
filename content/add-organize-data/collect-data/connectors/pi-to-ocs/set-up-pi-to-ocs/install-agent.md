# Install the PI to OCS Agent

Follow these guidelines to install the PI to OCS Agent:

* Install the agent on a host computer separate from your PI Data Archive deployment.
* Use an account that has been granted Administrator privileges.
* Enable read access to Data Archive security tables and the PI points and data to be transferred.

You can download the PI to OCS Agent Installation kit and then transfer it to the computer that will host the agent.

**NOTE:** The PI to OCS Agent installation cannot be completed if the system time is not correct. Additionally, you will not be able to complete the PI to OCS Agent installation if Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration is enabled. See [Disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](xref:disable-ie-security) for details. 

## Configure access to PI Data Archive Security tables and PI point data

* Archive data (the PIARCDATA Security table)
* The PI points configuration table (PIPOINT Security table)
* The PI points and data to be transferred
