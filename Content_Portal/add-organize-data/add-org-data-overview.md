# Add and organize data

OCS provides a variety of methods to collect and organize data. You can transfer data to OCS directly from PI Server or from an external application. 

In the Sequential Data Store (SDS) you can store, retrieve, and organize any type of streaming data. You can attach meaning to data by defining assets that organize and visualize status and measurements for that data.
