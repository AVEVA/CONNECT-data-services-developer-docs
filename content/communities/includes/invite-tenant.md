## Prerequisites

- [!include[prereq-community-admin](prereq-community-admin.md)]

- You must have the email address for a user assigned community administration permissions from the tenant that you are inviting to the community.

## Step 1: Invite a tenant to the community

To invite another tenant to the community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community you want to invite another tenant to and select **Details**.

1. On the **Tenants** tab, select **Invite Tenant**.

1. Enter the email address for a community administrator from the invited tenant. Then select **Invite**.

  An email is sent to the community administrator.

## Step 2: Wait for invited tenant to accept invitation

After you invite another tenant, wait for its community administrator to accept the email invitation. To monitor whether the invitation is accepted, select the **Invitations** tab and view the invitation recipient for a status of **Invitation Accepted**. You may need to refresh the page to see an updated status.

Invitations are valid for 14 days before they expire. If the invitation is not accepted within that time, you must [resend the invitation](xref:community-resend-invitation). You must also resend the invitation if the invited tenant does not receive the initial email.

## Step 3: Confirm the invitation

To confirm an invitation, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. On the `Communities` overview page, find the community that you have invited another tenant to and select **Details**.

1. On the `Community Details` page, select the **Invitations** tab.

1. Select an invitation with a status of **Invitation Accepted**.

1. On the `Invitation Details` pane, select **Confirm Tenant**. 

  **Important!** When prompted for confirmation, review that the expected tenant is joining before you select **Confirm Tenant**.

The invitee's tenant is now part of the community.
