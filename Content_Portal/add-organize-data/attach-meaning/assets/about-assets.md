An asset is a container for data streams associated with a particular device or entity. When you create an asset, you scope it to a namespace and a set of streams within that namespace. Assets typically represent devices with multiple data streams. However, you can create an asset with only one stream if needed. 
You can create assets on an ad hoc basis or create them from an asset type, a template for creating similar assets.

Use the asset explorer in the OCS Portal to create assets and visualize selected data streams and properties for troubleshooting and analysis of the associated devices or entities.
