APIs related to querying Resource Usage Data


***

## Authentication

All endpoints referenced in this documentation require authenticated access. Authorization header must be set to the access token you retrieved after a successful authentication request.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Requests made without an access token or an invalid/expired token will fail with a 401 Unauthorized response.
Requests made with an access token which does not have the correct permissions (see security subsection on every endpoint) will fail with a 403 Forbidden.
Read [OCS Authentication documentation](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/tree/master/basic_samples/Authentication) on how to authenticate against OCS with the various clients and receive an access token in response.

## Error Handling
