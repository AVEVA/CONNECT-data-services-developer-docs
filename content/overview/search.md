# Search in OCS

Many pages in OCS include a search capability, including:

- Sequential Data Store (streams, types, stream views)
- Asset Explorer (assets, asset types)
- Software Management (edge systems, base configurations)
- Data Views (streams, assets)

This topic describes the available search query options.

## Search operators

You can use search operators to get more refined search results. Use the operators ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT`` in all caps.

**Note**: If multiple search terms are used without an operator, ``OR`` will be the assumed operator.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ``AND``  | AND operator. The query ``cat AND dog`` searches for both "cat" and "dog". |
| ``OR``   | OR operator. The query ``cat OR dog`` searches for either "cat" or "dog", or both. |
| ``NOT``  | NOT operator. The query ``cat NOT dog`` searches for "cat" or those without "dog". |
| ``*`` Â   | Wildcard operator. Matches 0 or more characters. See [Wildcard operator](#wildcard). |
| ``:``    | Field-scoped query. Specifies a field to search. See [Field-scoping operator](#fieldScoped). |
| ``( )``  | Precedence operator. The query ``wind AND (speed OR deviation)`` searches for either "wind" and "speed", or "wind" and "deviation". |

## <a name="wildcard"></a>Wildcard (``*``) operator

Searching for a value finds only exact, whole-word matches. As an example, searching for "temperature" will not match a field value of "temperatures". You can use the wildcard operator (``*``) to match a partial search term. The wildcard can be used in the front (``*``perature), middle (tem``*``rature), or at the end (temp``*``) of each search term. It can only be used once for each search term, except to enclose a term (``*``perat``*``). OCS does not support wildcard operators in the middle and at the front or end of a term (te``*``pera``*`` is invalid).

| **Query string** | **Matches field value** | **Does not match field value** |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ``log*``         | log<br>logger           | analog                         |
| ``*log``         | analog<br>alog          | logg                           |
| ``*log*``        | analog<br>alogger       | lop                            |
| ``l*g``          | log<br>logg             | lake swimming (``*`` does not span across tokens) |

## <a name="fieldScoped"></a>Field-scoping (``:``) operator

The field-scoping operator limits the search to a specific field, such as ``id:``, ``name:``, ``description:``, and ``metadatakey:``.

Stream metadata keys are only searchable in association with their values. Without the field-scoping operator, a search is limited to metadata values, along with other searchable fields in the stream. For example, searching streams for "sourcetag" only finds items if they include sourcetag as a value, but searching for "sourcetag:*" finds all streams that have a sourcetag metadata key.

## Special characters in search queries

Add the backslash escape character ( \ ) before any special characters in search queries. The following special characters require an escape character: " | / * \ ( ) : 

The following are examples of using the escape character in query strings.

| Example Field Value                    | Query String                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Austin\Dallas\Fort Worth               | Austin\\\Dallas\\\Fort Worth               |
| 1:100                                  | 1\\:100                                    |

## Examples of query strings

| Query String | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Id:Id1 | assets, streams, stream types, stream views | Returns the item whose Id is **Id1**. |
| Id:Id* | assets, streams, stream types, stream views | Returns all items with Ids that begin with **Id**. |
| Name:Name1 | assets, streams, stream types, stream views | Returns all items with a name equal to **Name1**. |
| Id:Id AND Name:Name1 | assets, streams, stream types, stream views | Returns the item with an Id equal to **Id** and a name equal to **Name1**. |
| Description:floor1* | assets, streams, stream types, stream views | Returns all items with a description that starts with **floor1**. |
| Metadata/Serial Number:M0000* | assets, streams | Return all items that include metadata of the name "Serial Number" that start with **M0000** (such as M000099 and M000001). |
| Id:X* AND Metadata/Location:B* | assets, streams | Returns all items that contains: <ul><li>An Id starting with **X**.</li><li>A metadata with the name <code>Location</code> that has a value that starts with <code>B</code> (such as "Boston").</li></ul> |
| Tags:MarkedAsset | assets, streams | Returns all items that have **MarkedAsset** as a tag. |
| AssetTypeId:HeaterTypeId | assets | Returns all items with AssetTypeId matching **HeaterTypeId**. |
| AssetTypeName:HeaterTypeName | assets | Returns all items whose asset type Name field matches **HeaterTypeName**. |
| StreamPropertyId:Pressure | assets | Returns all items that have one or more stream references with the stream property ID **Pressure**. Note: This search only searches non-key Sds stream properties. |
| StreamReferenceName:Name1 | assets | Returns all items whose stream references contain a stream reference name that matches **Name1**. |

## Search result examples

When searching for the following streams:

**streamId** | **Name**  | **Description**
------------ | --------- | ----------------
stream1      | tempA     | Temperature from DeviceA
stream2      | pressureA | Pressure from DeviceA
stream3      | calcA     | Calculation from DeviceA values

Entering the following queries returns the following streams:

**Query string**     | **Returns**
------------------  | ----------------------------------------
``temperature``  | stream1
``calc*``        | stream3
``DeviceA*``     | stream1, stream2, stream3
``humidity*``    | nothing
