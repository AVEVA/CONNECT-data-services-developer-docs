# Overview of AVEVA™ Connect

[AVEVA Connect](https://connect.aveva.com/) is the common cloud platform on which AVEVA™ Data Hub sits. AVEVA Connect provides a central location for your organization's solutions. AVEVA Connect is used to perform the following tasks:

* [Access the AVEVA Data Hub portal](xref:sign-in-cnnxt)

* [Subscribe to AVEVA Data Hub and manage users and permissions](xref:subscribe-adh)

It is important to understand how solutions, folders, and permissions work before you configure AVEVA Connect to work with AVEVA Data Hub.

### What is a solution?

AVEVA Data Hub solutions are reflected as folders and tiles in AVEVA Connect. You can have multiple applications and capabilities in AVEVA Connect on a folder where data is shared across users in different regions; for example, AVEVA Data Hub and AVEVA Insight can both apply to a single folder.

### What are folders used for?

Folders in AVEVA Connect are used to partition data. They work analogously to folders in a traditional tree explorer. Folders represent your assets, but they can refer to any partition of data.

### How are permissions managed?

AVEVA Connect automatically provides all users with basic access to the customer account and adds them to the account's default user group. On the AVEVA Data Hub side, the administrator controls permissions by assigning groups to built-in AVEVA Data Hub roles.

If you are an administrator, you can learn more about AVEVA Connect in this guide and at the [AVEVA Connect User Documentation](https://help.connect.aveva.com/) website.
