# Get started: Communities

Communities allow a tenant to create a private group where operational data can be shared and viewed across other tenants. Using communities, industrial companies can share their data streams externally with trusted business partners, service providers, and analytics providers.

- Sharing data streams allows you and your partners to find value in each other's operational data:

- Collectively operate more efficiently and reduce waste.

- Detect hidden problems in your equipment and processes, helping to troubleshoot issues.

- Predict future failures before they occur.

- Share data across engineering and operational partners.

To create or join a community, follow the applicable scenario below listed in the headings below. Regardless of which scenario you follow, reviewing the following documentation on communities is recommended:

- <xref:communities>
