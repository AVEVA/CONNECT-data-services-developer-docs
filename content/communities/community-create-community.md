[!include[create-community-intro](includes/create-community-intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!include[prereq-administrative-tenant](includes/prereq-administrative-tenant.md)]

## To create a community

To create a community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Select **Add Community**.

    The **Create Community** wizard opens to the `Details` page.

1. On the `Details` page, enter a **Name** and **Description**. Then select **Next**.

1. On the `Community Administrators` page, choose the [roles](xref:ccRoles) that are assigned [community administration permissions](xref:community-community-roles#community-administrators). Users assigned these roles can perform administration tasks for both their own tenant and the entire community. You can either accept the default roles or add new ones.

   - To add community administrator permissions to a user role, select **Add Roles** > **Add Role** ![Add Role](../_icons/branded/plus.svg) for any role that you want to function as community administrator.

   - To remove community administrator permissions from a user role, select **Remove Role** ![Remove Role](../_icons/branded/window-close.svg) for the role that you want to remove.

    **Tip:** You can edit the default roles that are listed. For more information, see <xref:communities-manage-default-admins>.

1. After you finish, select **Next**.

1. On the `Community Members` page, add [Community Members](xref:community-community-roles#community-member), which are users within your tenant that have read access to the community and its data.
    
    To add new Community Members, select **Add Members** > ![Add]![Add Role](../_icons/branded/plus.svg) for each user or group that you want to add.

    **Note:** Community Administrators are not automatically added as Community Members. If you want your Community Administrators to also be Community Members with access to shared resources, you must manually add them.

1. After you finish, select **Create**.

The community is created and added to the `Communities` page.
