# Manage permissions

You can grant or deny members of a role the ability to perform certain actions in the `Manage Permissions` window. Actions, also referred to as access control, include the ability to read, write or delete data, as well as change role permissions.

Perform the following steps to manage role permissions in the AVEVA Data Hub portal.

1. Select the **Change Namespace** button in the upper right toolbar, then select the desired namespace.
 
   **Note:** Resource creators have complete access to the resource.   

1. Select the **Manage Permissions** ![](./images/manage-permissions.png) button in the upper-right toolbar.

   The `Manage Permissions` window opens.

1. Select the **Selected Role** field, then choose a role from the dropdown list. 

1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Allow** option next to any action (**Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, **Manage Permissions**) you want the role to be able to perform.
 
1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Deny** option next to any action (**Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, **Manage Permissions**) you do not want the role to perform.

1. After assigning permissions to the role, select **Save**.
