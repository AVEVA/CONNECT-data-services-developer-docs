# Asset types

Asset types provide a template for assets that share a common structure or type. You can define the expected metadata and stream references for assets that are created with the asset type. This makes it easier to compare assets of the same type and to ensure consistency across similar assets. Note the following characteristics of an asset created from an asset type:  

- The metadata associated with the asset is determined by the asset type. Therefore, you cannot add or remove metadata from the asset; however, you can edit the values of the metadata.
- The stream type for the asset is determined by the asset type. However, you must select the stream that is associated with the asset.
- The status mapping is determined by the asset type. You cannot change the mappings or select another measurement.
- You must assign a name to the asset and, optionally, a description.

There are two ways to create an asset type:

- Take an existing asset and convert it to an asset type. For more information, refer to [Convert an asset to an asset type](xref:ConvertAssetToAssetType).

- Create an asset type from the start. For more information, refer to [Create an asset type with the asset type editor](xref:CreateAssetType).
