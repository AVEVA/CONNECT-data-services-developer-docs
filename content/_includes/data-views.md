Data views allow you to access subsets of data items from AVEVA Data Hub in data-driven applications, where the items can be used for data science enablement. With data views, you can bridge your raw AVEVA Data Hub data to third-party applications like Microsoft Power BI, where it can be used for analytics, machine learning, and so on. Users can programmatically retrieve data view content using the AVEVA Data Hub API. Data views deliver shaped data that is ready for consumption because it is normalized, aligned, and contextualized.
