For technical assistance with AVEVA Data Hub or Connect, contact AVEVA Software Support through the [AVEVA Knowledge and Support website](https://softwaresupport.aveva.com/). You must have an account set up in the AVEVA Knowledge and Support Center before you can open a case. We can help you identify the problem, provide workarounds and address any concerns you may have. Note that remote access to your facilities may be necessary during the session.
