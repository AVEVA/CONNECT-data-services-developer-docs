# Data collection

Collect data from external sources and send it directly to OCS using the following methods:

* Use PI to OCS to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to OCS.

  * PI to OCS maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.

* Use OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) to pass JSON messages to OCS using an HTTP client. 

  * OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into OCS. 

* Use Software management to monitor the health and manage the configuration of software configuration on edge systems.
