# Community administration

After a community is established, the community administrator from each tenant can perform administrative actions to integrate new tenants and users in the community. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites for community administration

To perform most tasks related to community administration, you must have [community administration](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) permissions assigned to your user role. However, for some elevated administration tasks, you must be the community owner. Tasks that require community ownership are denoted.

## Community administration tasks

Community administrative actions include:

- <xref:managecommunityusers>

	Add or remove users within your tenant as community members.

- <xref:managecommunityclients>

	Allow an application to programatically access shared community data and resources using REST API.
