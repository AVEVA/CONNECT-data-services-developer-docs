# Technical support and other resources

For technical assistance on OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS), contact OSIsoft Technical Support at + 510-297-5828 or through the [OSIsoft Customer Portal](https://my.osisoft.com/). If you do not have a portal account, see [How to Get a Login to OSIsoft Customer Portal](https://explore.osisoft.com/myosisoft-customer-portal/how-to-get-a-login) to obtain one. You must have an account set up in the [OSIsoft Customer Portal](https://my.osisoft.com/) before you can open a case. We can help you identify the problem, provide workarounds and address any concerns you may have. Note that remote access to your facilities may be necessary during the session.
