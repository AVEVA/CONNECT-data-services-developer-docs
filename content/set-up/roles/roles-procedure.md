Roles are used to manage access to assets, resources, and services in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS). See the following topics for more information about roles:

- [Roles](xref:ccRoles)
- [PI Server counterpart](xref:ccRoles#roles-pi-server)
- [Roles best practices](xref:ccRoles#roles-bp)

## Procedure

Follow the procedure to create a role.

1. Click the ![Menu icon](../images/menu-icon.png) icon and click **Roles** (under Security).

1. In the toolbar, click **Add Role**.

1. Enter a **Name** for the role and, optionally, a **Description**.

1. Click **Add** to create the new role. It will be added to the table of Roles. Note that Tenant Custom is listed as the Role Type for all custom (or non-default) roles. You can now specify permissions for this role when managing permissions on assets, resources, and services in OCS.
