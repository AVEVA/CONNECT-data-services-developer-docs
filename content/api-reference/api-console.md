# API console

The API Console provides a graphical interface for using the REST API. When using the API Console, you select a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH action, select the objects for the action, and execute.

To use the API Console:

1. In the left pane, select **Developer Tools** > **API Console**.

1. Select a version from the dropdown list.

1. Select the **Root/Tenant path enabled** icon to toggle between a tenant-scoped path or a root-scoped path.

1. Select an action from the **GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH** dropdown list.

1. Type a slash (/) in the text field to display a dropdown list.

1.  If you selected a tenant-scoped path in the second step, you can take any of the following actions:

  - Select **Namespaces** and then select a namespace followed by an endpoint or route.

  - Select **Communities** and then select from a dropdown list of communities followed by an endpoint or route.

  - Select **OmfValidation** to validate an OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) JSON message.

  If you selected a root-scoped path in the second step, a different dropdown list gives you other categories of data. You can select one and then select an appropriate endpoint or route.

  The **Full Path** field shows an encrypted version of the selections you have made. Based on your selections, other fields may also be automatically prepended to the path. Together, these fields produce a path to a REST endpoint.

1. Select the blue button in the lower right, which shows the action you selected earlier.
    
  The request to the endpoint is issued based on the path you have constructed. For **POST** and **PUT** requests, the **Body** entry field displays. Type the request body into the **Body** entry field.

  **History** records the calls that you make so you can replay them again.
