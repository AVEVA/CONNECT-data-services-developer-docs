# Manage permissions for user roles

You can edit the permissions applied to a user role from any page in OSIsoft Cloud Services. You can apply different permissions to different user roles for each namespace. To manage permissions for user roles:

1. From the **Namespace** dropdown, select the namespace that you want to edit permissions for.

1. Select the **Manage Permissions** ![Manage Permissions](../../_icons/default/account-lock.svg) icon.

    ![Manage Permissions](images/manage-permissions.png)

    The `Manage Permissions for Namespace` window opens.

1. Use the `Manage Permissions for Namespace` window to:

    - Add user roles that have permissions in the namespace.
    - Edit permissions for each user role.

    For more information, see [Manage Permissions for Namespace window](#manage-permissions-for-namespace-window) <!-- TODO: Update xref -->.

1. When you are finished editing permissions, select **Save**.

    **Note:** This action overwrites any previous permission settings applied to the affected user roles.
