# Role-based access control 

Within OCS, role-based access control to entities such as Namespaces and Streams, is managed using an Access Control List (ACL) and an Owner identity assigned to each entity. ACLs control access to entities based on their OCS Roles.

Owners are granted access for all operations regardless of the contents of the ACL. Not all entities in the OCS system support role-based access control at this time, but the list will quickly grow and currently includes Namespaces and several unreleased entities.

## Access Control Lists

Access Control Lists (ACLs) contain sets of Access Control Entries (ACEs), each with a trustee (reference to an identity, such as a role, user, or application), AccessType, and AccessRights. 

A user or application that attempts to read, write, delete, or manage access control of an entity assigned an ACL must be assigned a trustee that has `AccessType` set to `Allowed` for the AccessRight corresponding to that operation.

AccessRights are the bitwise union of all of the access rights they encompass. For example, `AccessRights 3` indicates that Read and Write access is permitted.

### Notes
- If an operation requires more than one access right then an identity can obtain those rights from multiple ACL entries.
- `AccessType.Denied` takes precedence over `AccessType.Allowed`.
  - For example, a role that is assigned `AccessType.Denied` for `AccessRights.All` will receive a `forbidden` for all  requests unless they are the owner of the entity.
- Roles are the only TrusteeType supported for AccessControlList ACEs.
- At least one role must be given Manage Permission access.

| TrusteeType           | TypeId | 
|-----------------------|--------|
| User                  | 1      |
| Application           | 2      |
| Role                  | 3      |


| AccessType            | TypeId | 
|-----------------------|--------|
| Allowed               | 0      |
| Denied                | 1      |

### CommonAccessRightsEnum 

| AccessRights          | int  | bitwise |
|-----------------------|------|---------|
| None                  | 0    |    0000 |
| Read                  | 1    |    0001 |
| Write                 | 2    |    0010 |
| Delete                | 4    |    0100 |
| ManageAccessControl   | 8    |    1000 |
| All                   | 15   |    1111 |

### AccessControlList

The following code sample shows the structure and format for an ACL that gives Role 1 `Read` Access, Role 2 `All` access but denies Role 3 `ManageAccessControl` Access:

**Body**

Sample  body:
```json
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "RoleTrusteeAccessControlEntries": [
    {
    	"Trustee": {
    		"Type": 3,
    		"RoleId": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
    	},
    	"AccessType": 0,
    	"AccessRights": 1
    },
    {
		"Trustee": {
			"Type": 3,
    		"RoleId": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"
    	},
    	"AccessType": 0,
    	"AccessRights": 15
    },
    {
		"Trustee": {
    		"Type": 3,
    		"RoleId": "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"
    	},
    	"AccessType": 1,
    	"AccessRights": 8
	}
],
}
```

## Owner

Owner objects on OCS entities are used to grant access for all operations on the entity regardless of the entity's AccessControlList's AccessControlEntries. 

### Note
- Currently, only Users and Applications are valid owners for entities.  

### Trustee

The following code samples shows the format and structure of an owner object:

**User Owner Body**
```json
"Owner": {
	"Type": 1,
	"TenantId": "55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555",
	"ObjectId": "44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444"
},
```

**Application Owner Body**
```json
"Owner": {
	"Type": 2,
	"TenantId": "55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555",
	"ApplicationId": "66666666-6666-6666-6666-666666666666"
},
```
