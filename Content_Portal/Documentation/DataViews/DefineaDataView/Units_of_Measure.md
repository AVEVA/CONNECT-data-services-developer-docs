# Display units of measure (coming soon)

*Note: This topic covers features that are not yet generally available. If you are interested in trialing these pre-release features, contact your account team for more details.*

Data views can be configured to show the units of measure (Uom) from the underlying data source. This topic describes how to see the effective units of measure within a resolved data view, as well as the different options to include them in the data set itself.


## Units of measure in resolved data view
Units of measure are shown on each [data item field](xref:ResolvedDataView#dataitemfield), as well as any corresponding [data mappings](xref:ResolvedDataView#datamapping) where that data item field is used in the data view. If a unit of measure is not present in the underying data source, the `Uom` property is null.

If the unit of measure is consistent across all groups, then that unit of measure is reported on the [field mapping](xref:ResolvedDataView#fieldmapping) itself. Otherwise, the `Uom` property of the field mapping is null.

Note that in the resolved resources, units of measure are referenced by [id](xref:unitsOfMeasure).


## Units of measure in data view
Data views can be optionally configured to show units of measure within the data set. Units of measure are then directly visible to consumers of the data set. This is useful for consumers who are unable to examine the resolved data view and rely only on the data set. There are two ways to include units of measure on a per-field basis: as an additional field or within the field's label.

Units of measure are abbreviated when they appear in the data set. That is, the [abbreviation of the unit of measure](xref:unitsOfMeasure) is used: `cubic meter per second` is shown as a more consumer-friendly `m3/s`.


### Show units of measure within the data set
To show the units of measure within the data set, set the `IncludeUom` property of the field to `true`. This applies to both data fields and group fields. In this case, the field will resolve an additional, "sister" field mapping whose label is suffixed with the string "Uom'. 

#### Example
This simple example shows the `IncludeUom` property of a data field is set to `true`.
```json
{
  "Id": "quickstart",
  "Queries": [
    { 
      "Id": "inverters",
      "Kind": "Stream",
      "Value": "id:BILT.Meter.Primary.Inverter.0.PwrIn"
    }
  ],
  "DataFieldSets": [
    {
      "QueryId": "inverters",
      "DataFields": [
        {
          "Source": "PropertyId",
          "Keys": [ "Value" ],
          "Label": "{IdentifyingValue} {FirstKey}",
		  "IncludeUom": "true"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The resulting data view in standard mode:
| Timestamp            | Value | Value Uom |
|----------------------|-------|-----------|
| 2020-11-06T08:00:00Z | 1.21  | kW        |

The resulting data view in narrow mode:
| Timestamp            | Field | Value | Uom |
|----------------------|-------|-------|-----|
| 2020-11-06T08:00:00Z | Value | 1.21  | kW  |


### Show units of measure in field labels
The field label token `{Uom}` can be used to add field-level unit of measure to field labels. `{Uom}` is included in the default field label. If the unit of measure is consistent across all groups, `{Uom}` is resolved to the field-level unit of measure and displayed in the field label. Otherwise, if the unit of measure is not consistent across groups, use the alternative approach of `IncludeUom`.

#### Example
The following example shows how the field label token `{Uom}` of a data field is resolved.
```json
{
  "Id": "quickstart",
  "Queries": [
    { 
      "Id": "inverters",
      "Kind": "Stream",
      "Value": "id:BILT.Meter.Primary.Inverter.0.PwrIn"
    }
  ],
  "DataFieldSets": [
    {
      "QueryId": "inverters",
      "DataFields": [
        {
          "Source": "PropertyId",
          "Keys": [ "Value" ],
          "Label": "{IdentifyingValue} {FirstKey} {Uom}",
		  "IncludeUom": "false"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The resulting data view in standard mode:
| Timestamp            | Value kW |
|----------------------|----------|
| 2020-11-06T08:00:00Z | 1.21     |

The resulting data view in narrow mode:
| Timestamp            | Field    | Value |
|----------------------|----------|-------|
| 2020-11-06T08:00:00Z | Value kW | 1.21  |
