# Communities

OCS Communities allows industrial companies to share their operational data with external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. <!-- Angela Flores 6/15/21 Why is communities capitalized? -->

For example, with Communities, OCS tenants can perform the following actions:

- Share data with external partners without bringing their users inside the corporate firewall or taking extra security precautions.
- Share data without requiring external users to be onsite.
- Share data with external partners who do not have a PI System or other required software.

## Share data with a partner

The following process lists the high-level steps that are needed to share data. The process consists of creating a community, inviting other tenants, adding users and clients, and then sharing streams of data.

1. [Create a community](xref:add-community).
2. [Invite another OCS tenant](xref:managecommunity#invite-a-tenant-to-a-community) to join the community.
3. [Add users](xref:managecommunityusers#add-users-to-a-community) from your own tenant to the community.
4. [Add clients](xref:managecommunityclients#add-clients-to-a-community) for programmatic access to the community.
5. [Share streams](xref:ShareStreams) with the community.
