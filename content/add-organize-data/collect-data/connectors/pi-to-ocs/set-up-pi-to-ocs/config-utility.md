## Add an AF server

The PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility opens after an install or upgrade of a PI to OCS Agent. For first-time installations, the utility opens right after the agent is installed. If you are upgrading an agent, you can add a server after completing the upgrade.

The utility validates an AF server connection to ensure the following criteria is met:

* The AF server is not currently registered to any other agents under the same namespace as the current agent
* The installed version of PI Asset Framework (AF) supports the features required for transfers

**Note:** If you are not adding an AF server, skip to [Add a PI Data Archive](#add-a-pi-data-archive).

### Procedure

  1. In the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility, click the **AF** button.
![](..\..\images\utility-01.png)
2. Enter the name of your AF server in the **AF Server Name** text box, then click **Add Server**.

   **Result:** After successful detection, you are advanced to a screen that displays details about the data source connection and agent.
![](..\..\images\af-details-refreshed.png)
â€‹	**Note:** After the AF Server is added, the utility searches for any PI Data Archives referenced by the AF Server.

3. Review the AF source server details to ensure they are correct:
   * AF server name, version & ID
   * IP address
   * Connection status and timeout
4. Optional: Click the pencil icon next to the **Connection Timeout** field, then enter a different time interval.
5. Click **Save** to keep the current AF server configuration settings and restart the agent.

## Create an AF Mapping

You can assign an AF mapping to an AF identity. AF mappings enable a specific service account assigned to an AF identity in PI System Explorer to read and transfer AF element and attribute data.  The following applies to AF mappings:

* The user account used to launch the utility must have permission to create mappings.
* You can edit mappings.

### Procedure

1. Optional: Open the `PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility` window.
2. Click the pencil icon next to the **AF Mapping** field.

   **Result:** The **Configure AF Mapping** dialog box opens.

   **Note:** If an AF mapping has been created with another tool, a warning is displayed.  
5. Click **Close** to exit.

## Add a PI Data Archive

After adding an AF server, you have the option of adding a source PI Data Archive for PI point data. The list of available PI Data Archive servers is based on what servers are referenced by AF elements on the selected AF server. If you are upgrading an agent, the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility maintains the previously selected PI Data Archive configuration.  

### Procedure

1. Click the **Add Data Archive** **Server** button in the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility.

   **Result**:  The first screen of the **PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility** opens.

## Create a PI mapping 

PI mappings enable access to data stored on a PI Data Archive by service accounts assigned to a PI identity.  PI mappings can be created for a PI identity, user or group. Accounts assigned to a PI identity can read and transfer PI point data to OCS.  See ["What are PI identities and mappings?"](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v14/GUID-AD57C990-0DE6-4280-B9F3-1432C6E444C5) for more information. The following applies to PI mappings:

* The user account used to launch the utility must have permissions to create mappings.
* You can edit mappings.

### Procedure

1. Navigate to the PI Data Archive details page in the `PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility` window.

2. Click the pencil icon next to the **PI Mapping** field.
   **Result:** The **Configure Mapping** dialog box opens.

![Configure Mapping dialog box](..\..\images\configure-mapping-window.png)

3. Select one of the identities for the PI mapping, then click **Edit**.

   **Result:** The PI mapping is created for the selected identity, group or user.
   **Note:** If a PI mapping has already been created with another tool, a warning is displayed. 
4. Click **Close** to return to the utility.

## Set data privacy and add an agent description

You can set data privacy settings and assign a descriptive name to an agent. Data privacy controls if a host name of a PI Data Archive is published and displayed in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS). By default, OCS does not publish host names.  If you opt to have a host name published, it appears in the OCS portal on the `PI to OCS Agents` window as shown here. 

![Agent description and hostname displayed in PI to OCS Agents window](..\..\images\pi-to-ocs-agents-hostname.png)

This description appears where the agent is referenced and allows you to search by agent description.

### Procedure

1. In the `PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility` window, click the pencil icon to the right of **Agent Service Account**.
   **Result:** The **PI to OCS Agent Settings** dialog box opens.
