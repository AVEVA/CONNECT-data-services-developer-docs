# Open Message Format

You use Open Message Format ([OMF](http://omf-docs.osisoft.com/)) to achieve high-throughput asynchronous data collection
into the Sequential Data Store. The following terms are useful for understanding the information
in subsequent sections. 

- A producer of OMF messages needs a *client* identity to authenticate and send messages.

- An *OMF connection* takes the OMF messages from one or more *clients* and forwards them to the data store.

See [OMF editor](xref:omfEditor) for information on building and validating OMF messages.
