# Data Views

A data view is a user-selected subset of one or more streams stored in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS), mapped into custom tables. A data view includes data for use with a specific application or analysis, which is selected using a query for one or more data items.

Each column in a data view is mapped to a property of one or more data items. You can also organize data items into data groups within a data view in order for users to more easily compare similar properties in the same column.
