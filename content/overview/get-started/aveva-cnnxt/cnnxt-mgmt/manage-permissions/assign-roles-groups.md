# Step 2D: Assign Groups the Data Hub Viewer Role

Users cannot access AVEVA Data Hub until their group is assigned the DataHub Viewer role. This role adds the AVEVA Data Hub tile to the AVEVA Connect Home page when your folder is selected from the carousel.

To assign roles to a group:

1. From the AVEVA Connect home page, select ![menu](../../../../../_icons/default/menu.svg) > **User Management**.

1. Select the **Groups** tab.

   The existing groups are listed.

1. Select the group to which you want to assign roles.

1. Select the **Roles** tab. The list of existing roles assigned to the group is displayed.

   **Note:** You can search for the required group by typing a few letters in the **Filter by group name** field.

1. Select **Assign role** to assign more roles to the group.

   The `Assign role` area is displayed.

1. Select **Service role**.

1. From **Folder**, select the folder that you created in <xref:create-folders>.

1. From **Role**, select  **Data Hub Viewer**.

1. Select **Save** to save these changes.

   The role is assigned to the selected groups.
