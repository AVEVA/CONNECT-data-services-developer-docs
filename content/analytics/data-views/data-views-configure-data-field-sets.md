# Step 3: Configure data field sets

[!include[configure-data-field-sets](_includes/configure-data-field-sets.md)]

## Required step

Each query requires in your data view a minimum of one data field to be added to each field set.

- <xref:data-view-select-data-fields>

## Optional steps

After adding data fields to your field sets, you have the options to organize and group each field set.

- <xref:data-view-edit-data-fields> 
- <xref:data-view-configure-grouping-fields>
- <xref:data-views-configure-identifying-fields>
- <xref:data-view-link-fields>
- <xref:data-view-configure-field-order>

## Next steps

After you complete the required step above, along with any of the chosen optional steps, continue to <xref:data-view-choose-data-shape>.
