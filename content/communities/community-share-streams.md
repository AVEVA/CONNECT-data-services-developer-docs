# Share streams

Use these procedures to share streams of data with other communities. 

## Prerequisites to share streams

To share data streams with a community:

- There must already be data streams created within your tenant. For instructions, see <xref:gpStreams>.

- Your user role must be assigned the **Share** permissions for data streams. If you do not have these permissions, request them from a Tenant Administrator.

## To share streams

Users with the permissions to share streams within a community can share them using the Sequential Data Store. For instructions, see [Share stream](xref:manage-streams).
