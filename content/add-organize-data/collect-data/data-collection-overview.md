# Collect data

Collect data from external sources and send it directly to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub using the following methods:

* Use PI to Data Hub to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub. 
  
  * PI to Data Hub maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.
  
  * PI to Data Hub transfers AF elements and attributes as AVEVA&trade; Data Hub assets and metadata and properties.

* Use Open Message Format (OMF) to pass JSON messages to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub using an HTTP client. 
  
  * OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into AVEVA&trade; Data Hub. 

* Use Software management to monitor the health and manage the configuration of software configuration on edge systems.
