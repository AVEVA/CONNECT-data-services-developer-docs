# Step 1A: Log into AVEVA Connect

You can log into AVEVA Connect using one of the following sign-in methods:

* Corporate sign-in: federation for single sign-on

* Single user sign-in

* Third-party user access

**Note:** If you attempt a sign-in ten times consecutively with a wrong password from the same location (IP address), then your login is blocked. If this happens, contact [AVEVA Customer Support](https://softwaresupport.aveva.com) to unlock your account.

## Corporate sign-in: federation for single sign-on

Some AVEVA Connect accounts use Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which enables authentication and authorization to AVEVA Connect applications using the corporate user identity. This enables you to use single sign-on with the user account from the corporate domain.

To sign-in with single sign-on:

1. Browse to [AVEVA Connect](https://connect.aveva.com/).

1. Select **Sign in**.

1. Sign in with your credentials.

    The AVEVA Connect home page displays.

## Single user sign-in

To sign in as a single user:

1. Browse to [AVEVA Connect](https://connect.aveva.com/).

1. Select **Sign in**.

1. Sign in with your credentials.

    The AVEVA Connect home page displays.

## Third-party user access

A connection code enables third-party users to access specific accounts associated with an Identity Provider. Any accounts that are not intended for the third-party user are hidden.

**Note:** You must have a federated connection.

To sign in as a third-party user using a connection code:

1. Browse to [AVEVA Connect](https://connect.aveva.com/).
