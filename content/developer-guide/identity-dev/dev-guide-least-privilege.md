# Least privileges

When creating new users or client credential clients, configure them using the principle of Least Privilege. For more information, see the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency article [Least Privilege](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege). Assign users and clients the lowest privileged role necessary to access resources in OCS.

Ensure that clients which are not in use are either deleted or disabled by setting the **Enabled** property to false.
To limit the potential consequences of client credential theft, OSIsoft recommends against assigning client credentials clients the Administrator role. Any actions that require Administrator privileges should be done through the OCS portal, when possible. 
<!-- Angela Flores 6/18/21 This should have a link to a procedure topic with instructions for setting the Enabled property. Also the link to Least Priviledge points to a page the is marked archived and contains a warning that the information may be out of date. Can we find an up-to-date link? -->

## One client per application

OSIsoft recommends creating a client in OCS for each instance of a running application. This makes identification easier and decreases the attack surface from a leaked secret. In such an event, only one application needs to be updated.
