# Analytics

The Analytics menu provides tools for shaping and querying large datasets:

* Use the `Data Views` page to create subsets of data from one or more streams.

* The OCS Power BI Connector retrieves Data Views from OCS and makes them available in Microsoft Power BI for advanced data visualization and analysis.
