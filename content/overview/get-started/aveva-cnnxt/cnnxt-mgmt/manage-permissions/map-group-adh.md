# Add groups and assign roles

Add existing AVEVA Connect groups to AVEVA Data Hub and then assign roles to the group. Roles control the individual permissions assigned to users in the group, controlling the actions they can make in AVEVA Data Hub.

To assign an existing AVEVA Connect group to a Data Hub role:

1. Open the AVEVA Data Hub portal.

1. From the left pane, select **Security** > **Groups**.

1. Select **Add Group**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the name or first few characters of an AVEVA Connect group name, then press Enter.

1. Assign a role, or multiple roles, to the group to control the actions members can take in the AVEVA Data Hub portal, then select **Save**.

    AVEVA recommends mapping the Connect groups that you created in <xref:create-group> to the built-in tenant roles.

   - For more information on the six built-in tenant roles, see <xref:ccRoles>.
   - For more information on creating a custom role, see <xref:gpRoles>.
