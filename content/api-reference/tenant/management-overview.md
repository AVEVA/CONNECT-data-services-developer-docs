# Tenant management

The Tenant Management API allows users to create, manage, and administer AVEVA Data Hub tenants by assigning users and roles to their tenants. Through the API, users can manage access control that is used in the Data Hub infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the tenant management features. Administration functionality is also available from the AVEVA Data Hub portal.
