# ClientCredentialClient

Client credential clients are used for machine-to-machine communication without
            the presence of a User. 
            These clients are issued an Id and secret upon creation,
            which are later used for authentication against OSIsoft Cloud Services. More than one secret can be
            created for a client. You can read more about these clients
            [here](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/master/docs/AUTHENTICATION_README.md#client-credential-flow).
            Because they access resources on OSIsoft Cloud Services, and are not associated to users, these
            clients can be assigned any of the roles in the tenant. We suggest following a
            least privilege strategy when assigning roles to these clients, as they are more
            likely to operate in remote machines with a wider attack surface.

## Properties

For HTTP requests and responses, the ClientCredentialClient object has the following properties and JSON-serialized body: 

Property Name | Data Type | Description
 --- | --- | ---
RoleIds | Guid[] | List of Roles to be assigned to this client. Member role is always required. For security reasons we advise against assigning Admin roles to a client.
Id | string | Secret Id.
Name | string | Name of client.
Enabled | bool | Whether client is enabled. Client can be used for authentication if set to true. Client cannot be used for authentication if set to false.
AccessTokenLifetime | int32 | Lifetime of access token issued for this client after authentication. Minimum 60 seconds. Maximum 3600 seconds. Defaults to 3600 seconds.
Tags | string[] | For or OSIsoft internal use only.

### Serialized model

```json
{
  "RoleIds": [
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",

}
```

***

## Authentication

All endpoints referenced in this documentation require authenticated access. Authorization header must be set to the access token you retrieve after a successful authentication request.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Requests made without an access token or an invalid/expired token will fail with a 401 Unauthorized response.
Requests made with an access token which does not have the correct permissions (see security subsection on every endpoint) will fail with a 403 Forbidden.
Read [here](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/master/docs/AUTHENTICATION_README.md) on how to authenticate against OCS with the various clients and receive an access token in response.

## Error handling

All responses will have an error message in the body. The exceptions are 200 responses and the 401 Unauthorized response. The error message will look as follows:

```json
{
    "OperationId": "1b2af18e-8b27-4f86-93e0-6caa3e59b90c", 
    "Error": "Error message.", 
    "Reason": "Reason that caused error.", 
    "Resolution": "Possible solution for the error." 
}
```

If and when contacting OSIsoft support about this error, please provide the OperationId.

## `Create Client Credential Client`

Create a Client credential client. A Client Id and Client Secret will be generated to perform
            authentication. Make sure to store the secret somewhere safe as we do not store the
            actual value after the creation step. If you do not have access to the secret value, we suggest
            deleting the secret and adding a new one for this client. Clients have unique Ids in a tenant.
            Currently there is a limit of 50000 clients (of all types) per tenant.

### Request

`POST api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/ClientCredentialClients`

### Parameters

```csharp
[Required]
string tenantId
```

Id of tenant.

```csharp
[FromBody]
[Required]
ClientCredentialClientCreate clientCredentialClientCreate
```

ClientCredentialClientCreate object.

Property Name | Data Type | Required | Description 
 --- | --- | --- | ---
SecretDescription | string | No | Description for the initial secret for the client. Ensure that this is descriptive enough,            as it will be the only way to distinguish between multiple secrets and their usage for a            client.
SecretExpirationDate | DateTime | No | Expiration date for the initial secret for the client. If set to null the secret will            never expire. We advise against such practice.
RoleIds | Guid[] | Yes | List of Roles to be assigned to this client. Member role is always required.            For security reasons we advise against assigning Admin roles to a client.
Id | string | No | Client ID for this client. This ID should be a GUID.
Name | string | Yes | Name of client.
Enabled | bool | No | Whether client is enabled. Client can be used for authentication            if set to true. Client cannot be used for authentication if set to false.
AccessTokenLifetime | int32 | No | Lifetime of access token issued for this client after authentication.            Minimum 60 seconds. Maximum 3600 seconds. Defaults to 3600 seconds.
Tags | string[] | No | For OSIsoft internal use only.
