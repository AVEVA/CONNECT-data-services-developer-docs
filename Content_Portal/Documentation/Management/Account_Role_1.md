# Roles

A `Role` is a representation of a user’s job that is used to authorize access to resources necessary to accomplish that job. A user may have multiple roles assigned to it. All users are assigned the Account Member role by default. There are two predefined Roles for OCS accounts. Check the user or client role APIs for more information.
- Account Administrator
- Account Member
