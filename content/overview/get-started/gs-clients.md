# Get started with clients

Clients provide a way for users or applications to authenticate against OCS from applications other than the portal. OCS supports different client types, each of which support different types of applications:

- Client-credentials clients – used for server-to-server communication where no user interaction is required.

- Authorization code clients – used with customer web applications that use OCS as their backend.

- Hybrid clients – used by native and server-side web applications.

You can start with any of the clients and progress to the other two.
