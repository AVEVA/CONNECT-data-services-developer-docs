# Field set options

A data view includes one or more data field sets, which are collections of data fields originating from the same query. A data field is a property or metadata from the streams or assets included in a query. One field serves as the index while others contain information related to the data items (streams or assets).

After adding your initial field sets in <xref:data-view-select-data-fields> When configuring a data view, you can configure the data field set for each query by choosing which data fields you want to include in the data view.

## Optional steps

After adding data fields to your field sets, you have the options to organize and group each field set.

- <xref:data-views-configure-identifying-fields>
