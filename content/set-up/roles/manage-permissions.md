   The `Manage Permissions` window opens.

1. Select the **Selected Role** field, then choose a role from the dropdown list. 

1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Allow** option next to the actions you want the role to be able to perform.
 
1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Deny** option next to the actions you do not want the role to perform.
