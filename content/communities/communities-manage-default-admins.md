# Manage default community administrators

When you create or join a community, you are prompted to assign community administration permissions to one or more role within your tenant. By default, these permissions are assigned to three default system roles: Community Administrator, Super Admin, and Tenant Administrator. 

However, you can update these default roles to any system role. For example, you can configure a custom system role named **Community Manager** as the default community administrator.

## To manage default community administrators

To manage default community administrators, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Select **More Options** ![More Options](../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Manage Default Community Administrators**.

1. Add or remove roles as default community administrators. 

	To add a role, select **Add Roles** and then select **Add Role** ![add role](../_icons/plus-thick-alt.svg) for any role that you want to function as community administrator. 

	To remove a role, select **Remove Role** ![Remove Role](../_icons/remove-object.svg).

1. Select **Save**.

The default community administrator roles are updated. The next time that you create or join a community, the community administrator defaults to your settings.
