# Client Roles

Client `Roles` authorize API requests made by clients to various OCS features. Clients can be assigned more than one
`Role`, but all clients have the Account Member role. The following are currently available Client `Roles`:
- Account Administrator: Can add, edit, and remove data using APIs.
- Account Member: Can read data using most APIs.


## Properties

For HTTP requests and responses, the ClientRole object has the following properties and JSON-serialized body: 

| Property | Type | Description | 
 | --- | --- | ---  | 
| ClientId | string | Client Id. | 
| RoleId | string | Role Id. | 


```json
{
	"ClientId": "clientid",
	"RoleId": "roleid"
}
```
