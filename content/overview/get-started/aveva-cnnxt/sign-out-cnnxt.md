## Sign out of AVEVA™ Connect

Some AVEVA™ Connect application environments are independent of each other. To switch between application environments you should sign out before attempting to sign in to another application.

When you have completed your session within AVEVA™ Connect, you must sign out. To do this, select the profile icon on the top-right in AVEVA™ Connect, and then select **Sign Out**.

Within an application, the log out process is similar.
