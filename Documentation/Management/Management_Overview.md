Management
=======================================================

You use the Account Management APIs to create, manage, and administer your account by assigning users, roles, and 
namespaces to your tenant. Using the APIs, you can manage all aspects of access control for use by OSIsoft Cloud 
Services (OCS) infrastructure. Generally, only administrators access the Account Management features. All 
administration functionality is also available from the OCS portal.
