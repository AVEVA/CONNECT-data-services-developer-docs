# Tenants

APIs to manage an OCS Customer Tenant Account. Unlike Namespaces, Tenants are not scoped to a region. Account level information, such as Users and Clients, is stored in all supported regions for read-only purposes. Write operations for account management and identity management are only supported through the global base URL. Unsupported requests return a status of ``Method Not Allowed`` (405). The resolution is to utilize the global base URL (https://dat-b.osisoft.com/) for write operations that are not scoped to a namespace.

## Properties

For HTTP requests and responses, the Tenant object has the following properties and JSON-serialized body: 

| Property Name | Data Type | Description | 
 | --- | --- | ---  | 
| Id | string | GUID for this Tenant. Generated by the server upon Creation. Same as AAD Id. | 
| CompanyName | string | Company Name of this Tenant. | 
| State | TenantProvisioningState | Current Tenant Provisioning State for this Tenant. | 
| Created | DateTime | Date and time this Tenant was added to OCS. | 
| LastUpdated | DateTime | Date this Tenant was last updated. | 
| Alias | string | Specifies a unique alias for this Tenant | 
| Features | [FeatureState] | List of Feature States for this Tenant. Returned during get calls. |
