# Enable stream sharing permissions

Before your tenant users can share data within a community, you must first manage stream permissions for your tenant. To allow stream sharing, you must allow the **Share** access type for one or more user role. Users assigned this role will then have permission to share streams within a community. You can enable stream sharing for all streams or on a per-stream basis.

- For instructions on how to enable sharing for all streams, see <xref:manage-streams#manage-permissions>.

- For instructions on how to enable sharing on a per-stream basis, see <xref:manage-streams#manage-permissions>.
