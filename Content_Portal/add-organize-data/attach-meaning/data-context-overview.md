# Attach meaning to data

You can create asset definitions to help organize and visualize information about a particular asset, such as a truck or a mixing tank. You categorize asset data by specifying:

1.	Metadata, such as make and model
2.	Measurements, such as location or temperature
3.	Status, such as online or inactive
