Samples
=======

The [OCS-Samples](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS) illustrate several ways for applications to interact with the OCS REST API.

The examples cover the basics of interacting with OCS, such as:

* Connecting to OCS
* Creating SdsTypes and instances of SdsStreams 
* Sending data to and retrieving data from SdsStreams 
* Performing queries against SdsStreams 
* Removing SdsStreams and SdsTypes

Currently, the samples are available in these languages:

* [.NET](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/tree/master/docs/SDS_WAVEFORM_DOTNET_README.md) 
* [Java](https://github.com/osisoft/sample-ocs-waveform-java)
* [Python](https://github.com/osisoft/sample-ocs-waveform-python)
* [NodeJs](https://github.com/osisoft/sample-ocs-waveform-nodejs)
* [Angular](https://github.com/osisoft/sample-ocs-waveform-angular)

Because the examples are intended for demonstration purposes, they represent some example practices. The patterns may change as OCS continues to develop. Be sure to follow the [OSI-Samples](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples) repository on GitHub for updates.
