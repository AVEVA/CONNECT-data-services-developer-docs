# Step 2D: Assign Groups the Data Hub Viewer Role

Users cannot access AVEVA Data Hub until their group is assigned the DataHub Viewer role. This role adds the AVEVA Data Hub tile to the AVEVA Connect Home page when your folder is selected from the carousel.

To assign roles to a group:

1. From the AVEVA Connect home page, select ![menu](../../../../../_icons/default/menu.svg) > **User Management**.

1. Select the **Roles** tab.

1. Select **Assign role**.

   The `Assign role` area is displayed.

1. Verify that the **Service role** option is selected.

1. From **Service**, select **Data Hub (Int)**.

1. From **Folder**, select the folder that you created in <xref:create-folders>.

1. From **Role**, select **Data Hub Viewer**.

1. From **Groups**, select the groups that you created in <xref:create-group>.

1. Select **Save** to save these changes.

   The **Data Hub Viewer** role is assigned to the selected groups.
