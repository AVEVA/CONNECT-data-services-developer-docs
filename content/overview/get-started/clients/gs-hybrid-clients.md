# Get started with hybrid clients

Hybrid clients are used by native and server-side web applications. Authentication can be performed using any supported browser. The server-side code retrieves an access token and a refresh token can also be provided. For more information about hybrid clients, see [Hybrid clients](xref:ccClients#hybrid-client).

To create a hybrid client, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Clients**.

1. From the **Client Type** field, select **Hybrid**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Client**.

   The `Add Client` window appears.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name to identify the device or application that will use this client.

1. (Optional) Select the **Allow Refresh Token** checkbox if the application uses refresh tokens to keep users logged in to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub.
   
   **Note:** Avoid selecting this option if there is no need to refresh tokens. There is a long lifespan for requesting new access tokens. 

1. Enter the URLs in the **Allowed Redirect URL(s)** field, then click **+** to add it to the list.  
   
   The application specifies one of the URLs in this list during authentication, and AVEVA Data Hub returns the results of the authentication to this URL.

1. (Optional) In the **Allowed Logout Redirect URL(s)** box, enter a URL and select **+** to add it to the list.  
   
   The application specifies one of the URLs from this list when it logs a user out of AVEVA Data Hub, and the identity server sends the user to that URL after a successful log out.

1. (Optional) In the **Token Lifetime** field, enter the length of time in seconds that the access token functions before it expires. 

   The default, 3600 seconds (one hour), is the maximum length of time. The minimum value is 60 seconds.

1. Select **Add**.  

1. In the `Add Secret` window, enter a description for the secret. Include a unique description if you plan to create multiple secrets.

1. Enter an expiration date.

    Choose an expiration date that is appropriate for your use case. By default, the secret is set to expire one year after creation. You may specify that the secret does not expire by selecting the **Never Expires** checkbox. Secrets can be deleted later, including secrets that are set to never expire.

1. Select **Add**.
   
    The **Client Successfully Created** window opens and displays the client Id and client secret Id.

    **Important:** Select the **Copy** buttons to the right of the **Client Id** and **Client Secret** fields to save a copy of these Ids for your records. You will need to reference these Ids in your applications. Once the window is closed, the client secret cannot be accessed or retrieved.

1. Select **Close**.

    **Note:** The client ID is visible on the client. If you did not save the client secret, select the client in the list and use the Details pane to remove the old secret and add a new secret. Client modifications may take up to an hour before being visibly updated.

- [Get started with authorization code clients](xref:gsAuthorizationCodeClients)

When all three are complete, continue with [Get started with assets](xref:gsAssets).
