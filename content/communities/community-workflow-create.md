# Workflow to create community

To begin the process of sharing data, create a new community and invite other tenants to join.

**Tip:** Looking for instructions on how to join a community? See <xref:community-workflow-join>.

## Prerequisites

To create a new community, you must:

- Be assigned a user role configured as a default community administrator (**Community Administrator** and **Tenant Administrator** roles by default).

- Have the email address for a community administrator from the tenant that you are inviting to the community.

## Community creation outline

Complete the following procedures to start a new community and invite other tenants.

- <xref:community-create-community>

	[!include[create-community-intro](includes/create-community-intro.md)]

- <xref:community-invite>

	This procedure provides instruction on how to invite other tenants to join your community. After sending an invitation, wait for the invited tenant to accept it. Once the invited tenant accepts, you can confirm the tenant's participation.

- <xref:community-manage-sds-permissions-create>

	Manage permissions for data streams to allow Community Members from your tenant to share streams with the community.
