# Get started with clients

Clients provide a way for users or applications to authenticate against OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) from applications other than the OCS portal. OCS supports different client types, each of which support different types of applications. For more information on client types, see the following topics: 
- [Client-credentials clients](xref:gsClientCredentialsClients)
- [Authorization code clients](xref:gsAuthorizationCodeClients)
- [Hybrid clients](xref:gsHybridClients)

You can start with any of the clients and progress to the other two.
