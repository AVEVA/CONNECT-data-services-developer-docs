# Community administration

After a community is established, the community administrator from each tenant can perform administrative actions to integrate new tenants and users in the community. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites for community administration

You must have [community administration](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) permissions assigned to your user role.

## Community administration tasks

Community administrative actions include:

- <xref:managecommunityusers>

	Add or remove users within your tenant as community members.

- <xref:managecommunityclients>

	Allow an application to programatically access shared community data and resources using REST API.

- <xref:community-remove-tenants>

	Remove tenants from a community. 

- <xref:delete-community>

	Delete the community. 
	
	**Note:** You must be a [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview) (not a Community Administrator) to delete a community.
