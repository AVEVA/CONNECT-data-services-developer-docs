# Get started with communities (Preview)

The communities feature has different workflows based on your user role within the system. Refer to the following workflows to get started with tasks related to your system role.

## About communities

To learn more about communities, see <xref:communities>.

## Community setup 

Tenant Administrators provision new communities and invite other tenants to participate. During this process, they assign community administration permissions to another user role and invite tenant users to the community. For more information, see <xref:community-workflow-create>.

Invited tenants must accept the invitation before they can begin particapting in the community. The Tenant Administrator for the invited community can complete this process. For more information, see <xref:community-workflow-join>.
   
## Community administration

After the community is established, users assigned [community administrator permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) can manage the community within the tenant. Users with these permissions can add new tenants to the community, add new users, and so on. For more information on the tasks that community administrators can perform, see <xref:community-administration>.

## Data sharing and viewing

Within established communities, Community Members perform tasks related to sharing and viewing data within the community. For more information, see <xref:data-sharing>.
