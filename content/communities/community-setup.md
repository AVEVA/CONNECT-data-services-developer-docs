# Community setup

Establish a community by creating it and then inviting other tenants owned by business partners. Each invitation is a three-way handshake. A [Tenant Administrator](xref:ccRoles#tenant-roles) from the establishing tenant sends an email invitation to a Tenant Administrator from another tenant. The invited tenant then accepts the invitation. The original Tenant Administrator who issued the invitation confirms it, allowing the invited tenant to join the community.
