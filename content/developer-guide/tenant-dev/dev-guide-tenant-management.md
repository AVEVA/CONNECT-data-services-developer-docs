# Tenant management

The Tenant Management API allows you to manage and administer AVEVA&trade; Data Hub tenants by assigning users and roles to tenants. Through the API, you can manage access control to the AVEVA&trade; Data Hub infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the tenant management features. Administration functionality is also available from the AVEVA&trade; Data Hub portal.
