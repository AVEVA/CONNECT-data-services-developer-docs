# Data collection

The Data Collection menu provides a number of methods for collecting data from external sources to bring into AVEVA Data Hub:

* Use `Edge Data Store & Adapters` to monitor the health and manage the software configuration on systems.

* Use `PI to AVEVA Data Hub Agents` to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to AVEVA Data Hub. PI to AVEVA Data Hub maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.

* Use `OMF Connections` to pass JSON messages to AVEVA Data Hub using an HTTP client. OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into AVEVA Data Hub.
