# Tenant management

The Tenant Management API allows you to create, manage, and administer OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) tenants by assigning users, roles, and namespaces to tenants. Through the API, you can manage access control to the OCS infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the tenant management features. Administration functionality is also available from the OCS portal.
