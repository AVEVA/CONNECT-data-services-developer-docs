# Security

The Security menu provides tools to manage access to AVEVA Data Hub:

* Use `Identity Providers` to add third-party services that store and authenticate users.

* Use the `Groups` page to assign and manage roles for groups of users.

* Use the `Users` page to add, edit, or remove users.

* Use `Roles` to add roles, which manage access to assets, resources, and services, and assign these roles to identities, which include users, groups, and client-credentials clients. 

* Use `Clients` to create and manage clients, which are used to authenticate against AVEVA Data Hub from outside the portal.
