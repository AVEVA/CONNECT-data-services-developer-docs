# Add a client

Clients provide a way for users or applications to authenticate against OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) from applications other than the OCS portal. OCS supports the following client types, each of which support different types of applications:
- [Client credentials client](xref:gpClientCredentialsClient)
- [Authorization code clients](xref:gpAuthorizationCodeClient)
- [Hybrid clients](xref:gpHybridClient)

You must have the **Tenant Administrator** role to add and manage clients in a tenant.
