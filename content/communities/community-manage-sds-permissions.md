# Enable stream sharing permissions

After you create or join a community, you must explicitly allow your tenant users to share data streams within the community. You can complete this action by browsing to **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**, selecting streams for permission updates, and then applying permission updates to existing tenant roles. You can enable stream sharing permissions on a per-stream basis. Users assigned the updated roles will then have permission to share specific streams within a community based on their assigned user roles. For instructions on how to allow stream sharing, see [Manage streams: Manage permissions](xref:manage-streams#manage-permissions).
