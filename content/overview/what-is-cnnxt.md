# Overview of AVEVA™ Connect

AVEVA™ Connect (https://connect.aveva.com/) is the common cloud platform on which AVEVA™ Data Hub sits. AVEVA™ Connect provides a central location for your organization's solutions. AVEVA Connect is used to perform the following tasks:

* [Access the Data Hub portal](xref:sign-in-cnnxt)
* [Subscribe to Data Hub and manage users and permissions](xref:what-is-cnnxt)

It is important to understand how solutions, folders, and permissions work before you configure AVEVA Connect to work with AVEVA™ Data Hub.

### What is a solution?

A solution is the product that AVEVA™ makes available to customers. AVEVA™ Data Hub solutions are reflected as folders in AVEVA™ Connect. You can enable multiple applications and capabilities in AVEVA™ Connect on a folder where data is shared with multiple applications; for example, AVEVA™ Insight.

### What are folders used for?

Folders in AVEVA™ Connect are used to partition data. They work analogously to folders in a traditional tree explorer. Folders represent your assets, but they can refer to any partition of data.

### How are permissions managed?

AVEVA Connect has two built-in permissions. All users are automatically provided with basic access to the customer account and added to the account's default user group. On the AVEVA Data Hub side, the administrator controls permissions by assigning groups to built-in Data Hub roles.

If you are an administrator, you can learn more about AVEVA Connect in this guide and also on the official [AVEVA™ Connect User Documentation](https://help.connect.aveva.com/#/index/10/11) website.
