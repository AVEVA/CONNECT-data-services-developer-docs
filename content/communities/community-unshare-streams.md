## Unshare streams from Community Details

To stop sharing streams, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community where you are sharing streams and select **Details**.

1. On the `Community Details` page, select the **Tenants** tab.

1. Select your own tenant.

   A pane opens on the right.

1. On the **Streams** tab, select the streams you want to stop sharing, then select **Unshare Streams**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Unshare**.

The streams are unshared from the community. Other tenants in the community can no longer view them.

## Unshare streams from the Sequential Data Store

Streams can also be unshared from the Sequential Data Store. For more information, see [Unshare streams](xref:manage-streams#unshare-streams).
