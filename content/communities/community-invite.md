# Invite a tenant to a community

To allow another tenant to participate in your community, you must complete a three-way handshake that includes the following steps:

- A [tenant administrator](xref:ccRoles#tenant-roles) from the establishing tenant, also known as the community owner, sends an email invitation to a tenant administrator from another tenant. 

- The tenant administrator from the invited tenant accepts the invitation.

- The community owner who issued the invitation confirms it, allowing the partner to begin participating in the community. The community is private; users outside of your community cannot access it without an invitation.

**Note:** These instructions are written for the community owner who is *sending* the invition. For instructions for the tenant administator *receiving* the invitation, see <xref:community-accept-invite>.

## Prerequisites for sending community invitations

To send a community invitation, you must meet the follow prerequisites:

- Your user account must be assigned [community administration](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) permissions.

- Your business partner must already have a tenant in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS).

- You must have the email address for the tenant administrator from the tenant you are inviting.
