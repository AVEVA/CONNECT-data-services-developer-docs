# Community tenant administration

After a community is established, users assigned community administrator permissions from each tenant can manage their community. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

## Prerequisites

To perform most tasks related to community administration, you must have [community administrator permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) assigned to your user role or be a [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview). Some tasks require you to be a Community Owner, as denoted in [Community owner tasks](#community-owner-tasks).

## Community administration tasks

Either a user assigned community administrator permissions or a Community Owner can perform the following tasks:

- <xref:community-remove-your-tenant>

	Remove your own tenant from the community.
