<p>The standard table column structure is built horizontally from left to right. The index field is first, followed by the grouping fields, if any exist.  Data field sets come next, in the order they are presented in the data view. Fields are presented in order of appearance within each data field set for each data item from the associated query.</p>
<p>Vertically, the standard structure depends on the inclusion of grouping fields. If grouping fields are not defined, each resultant index appears only once, and all interpolated data is in that row. If grouping fields are defined, then the resultant indexes will repeat vertically for each group. The groups are presented in alphabetical order.</p>
