Assets are objects used to represent physical entities in OCS.  Assets typically represent devices with multiple data streams, although you can create an asset with only one stream if needed.

An asset is a container for data streams associated with a particular device or entity. When you create an asset, you scope it to a namespace and a set of streams within that namespace. You can create assets on an ad hoc basis or create them from an asset type, a template for creating similar assets.

When you create assets in OCS, you can use the Asset Explorer in the OCS Portal to visualize selected data streams and properties for troubleshooting and analysis of the associated devices or entities.
