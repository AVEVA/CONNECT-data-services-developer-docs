Samples
=======

The OCS-Samples illustrate several ways for applications to interact with the OCS REST API.

The examples cover the basics of interacting with SDS, such as:

* Connecting to OCS
* Creating SdsTypes and instances of SdsStreams 
* Sending data to, and retrieving data from SdsStreams 
* Performing queries against SdsStreams 
* Removing SdsStreams and SdsTypes

Currently, the samples are available in these languages:

* C# 
* Java
* Python

Because the examples are intended for demonstration purposes, they represent some example
practices. The patterns may change as the OCS Preview progresses. Be sure
to follow the OCS-Samples repository on GitHub for updates.
