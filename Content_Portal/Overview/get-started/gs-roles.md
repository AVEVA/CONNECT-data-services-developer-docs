# Getting started with roles

Roles are used to manage access to assets, resources, and services in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS). Roles are assigned to identities, which includes users, groups, and client-credentials clients. See the following for more information about roles:

- [About roles](#ccRoles)
- [Roles PI Core counterpart](xref:ccRoles#roles-pi-core)
- [Roles best practices](xref:ccRoles#roles-bp)

## Creating a role

Find the Roles page in the OSIsoft Cloud Services portal [here](https://cloud.osisoft.com/roles).

1. In the toolbar, click **Add Role**.

1. Enter a Name for the role and, optionally, a Description.

1. Click **Add** to create the new role. It will be added to the table of Roles. Note that the **Role Type** is listed as **Account Custom** for all custom (or non-default) roles. You can now specify permissions for this role when managing permissions on assets, resources, and services in OCS.

Note: By default, the new role will not have any access granted or denied in OCS.
