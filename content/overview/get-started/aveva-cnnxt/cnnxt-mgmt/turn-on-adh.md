# Turn on AVEVA™ Data Hub

 Before AVEVA™ Data Hub can receive data for a given tenant, a folder must exist for that tenant. When you turn on the AVEVA™ Data Hub service and set up a folder in AVEVA™ Connect, a namespace is created with the same folder name. To change the name of a namespace, you must rename the namespace folder name in AVEVA™ Connext.

For more information about namespaces, see the following topics:

- [Namespaces](xref:AccountNamespace_1) API
