# Add and remove community clients

<!--- Check links to Laureen's topics after her stuff is merged! --->

In OCS, clients are applications that act on behalf of users and allow programmatic access via APIs to shared data and resources.

The `Community Details` page lets you add and delete clients. Currently, you can only add [client-credentials clients](xref:ccClients) to a community.

To perform the following procedures, you must be a [Community Administrator](xref:communityroles#community-administrator) or [Community Moderator](xref:communityroles#community-moderator).

## Add clients to a community

To add a client to a community, the client must already exist in OCS. Only a [Tenant Administrator](xref:communityroles#tenant-administrator) can create a client. For more information about creating clients, see [Add a client credentials client](xref:gpClientCredentialsClient).

1. On the `Communities` overview page, find the community where you want to add clients and click **Details**.
2. On the `Community Details` page, click the **My Clients** tab.
3. Click **Add Client**.
4. Select the clients to add. If necessary, you can filter the list of clients by typing in the **Filter clients** box.
5. Click **Add**.

## Remove a client from a community

1. On the `Communities` overview page, find the community where you want to remove clients and click **Details**.
2. On the `Community Details` page, click the **My Clients** tab.
3. Select a client to remove.  If necessary, you can filter the list of clients by typing in the **Filter clients** box. 
4. Click **Remove Client**.  When prompted for confirmation, click **Remove Client**.
