# Manage data field sets

Following initial creation and configuration of a data view and its data field sets for each query, you can go back and edit each field set, adding new fields, editing existing fields, or removing fields from the field set.

## Add data field to field set

Each data field set is composed of data fields from streams or assets. You can organize your data view to use one or more of these fields to group your data view. The fields you choose to use for grouping display in the data view to the immediate right of the index field.

1. In the left pane, select **Analytics** > **Data Views**.

1. Select the data view that you want to edit.

1. Select **Edit Data View**.

1. From the left panel, select **Add**.

	The **Add Data Fields** window opens, listing the field set for each query. 

1. Add the data fields that you want to include in your field sets.

	**Note:** Each data field set must include each least one field. If you edit a data view that includes a query with no data fields in its field set, you are prompted automatically prompted to add data fields to the set.

1. Select **Apply**.

The data fields are added to the field set.
