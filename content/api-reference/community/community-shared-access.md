# Shared Access

The Shared Access service brokers all requests for a shared resource in a community. Currently, streams are the only shared resources.

When a resource is shared in a community, users with the **Community Member** role are able to access metadata and data for that resource. Community members are limited to read-only access.

## Request

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> All routes use the standard SDS service. Please see [Streams](xref:sdsStreams) and [API calls for reading data](xref:sdsReadingDataApi) in the [Sequential Data Store](xref:sds) section for specific request and response information.

***

> [!NOTE]
>
> Any routes that modify a shared resource are unavailable.

## Authorization

Allowed for the **Community Member** role in a community where the stream is shared. Having the **Community Member** role indicates you are a member of the community.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Both the user's tenant and the tenant of the shared resource must be a part of the community in the route.

## Examples

Responses are identical to those from the SDS service. See the following examples (Source:[Read data API](xref:sdsReadingDataApi)).

### Get Event Example request

```text
GET api/v1-preview/communities/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/Tenants/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/Namespaces/MyNamespace/Streams/Simple/Data?index=2017-11-23T13:00:00Z&searchMode=Next
```

The request has an index that matches the index of an existing event, but because an `SdsSearchMode` of ``next`` was specified, the response contains the next event in the stream after the specified index:

#### Get Event Example response body

```text
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
[
    {
        "Time": "2017-11-23T14:00:00Z",
        "State": 0,
        "Measurement": 20
    }
]
```

### Filter Example request

```text
GET api/v1-preview/communities/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/Tenants/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/Namespaces/MyNamespace/Streams/Simple/Data?filter=Measurement gt 10
 ```

The events in the stream with `Measurement` greater than 10 are returned.

#### Filter Example response body

```json
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "Time": "2017-11-23T14:00:00Z",
        "Measurement": 20
    },
    {
        "Time": "2017-11-23T15:00:00Z",
        "Measurement": 30
    },
    {
        "Time": "2017-11-23T16:00:00Z",
        "Measurement": 40
    }
]
```
