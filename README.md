# AVEVA Data Hub Docs

AVEVA Data Hub is an AVEVA Connect application for storing, retrieving, and analyzing sequentially indexed data. This repository contains the documentation for AVEVA Data Hub.
## Notes

This repository is forked from the [OSIsoft Cloud Services documentation repository](https://github.com/osisoft/OCS-Docs). Updates from this upstream repository are synced to the AVEVA Data Hub documentation repository periodically.

AVEVA Data Hub is a rebranding of OSIsoft Cloud Services. When AVEVA completes this rebrand, the OSIsoft Cloud Services documentation repository will be retired, and the AVEVA Data Hubs documentation repository will supercede it at a date to be determined.
