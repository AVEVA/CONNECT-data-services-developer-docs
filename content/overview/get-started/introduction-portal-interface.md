The following features can be accessed from the menu:

- **Data Collection**: Bring data from multiple sources and systems into a namespace.

- **Visualization**: View data trends and use assets to set up digital twins of real-world physical entities.

- **Analytics**: Tools for shaping and querying large datasets.

- **Security**: Specify identity providers for authentication and add groups, users, roles, and clients to your tenant.

- **Developer Tools**: Code samples, an API console, and an editor for the OSIsoft Message Format (OMF).

- **Support**: Documentation, logs, support links, the OCS blog, and other useful information.

Most pages consist of two panes:

- The left pane is where you perform the tasks associated with the resource. For example, the left pane is where you add and edit the resource or manage its permissions.

- The right pane may contain a **Details** tab that contains additional information about the selected resource. Some resources also have additional panes for other configuration tasks.

## Portal toolbar

The portal toolbar is located in the upper-right corner of the portal window.
