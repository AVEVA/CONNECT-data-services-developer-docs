# AAD Consent to OSIsoft Applications

You have chosen to use your organizationâ€™s existing Azure Active Directory (AAD) to sign in to your
OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) account. In order to proceed, you first need to complete a consent workflow. In
this step, your AAD administrator will grant permissions for OCS Identity to do the following:

- Sign in and read user profile basic information (delegated permission).

Below are the next steps required to complete your OCS account provisioning:

- An email will be sent to your AAD administrator who has the privileges to grant OCS access to your AAD.
- Your administrator will click on the link provided in the email. Note that your administrator will need to log in as a user with the Global Administrator role on your AAD.
- Upon login, your administrator will be prompted to grant consent for a single application: OCS Identity.
- Your administrator should select the box "Consent on behalf of the organization" before clicking the consent button.
- OSIsoft will get a confirmation that the consent process has been completed.
- Then, a second email will be sent to the initial user who signed up for the account.
- At that point, this initial user will be able to use the link provided to activate his profile and sign in your OCS account.
