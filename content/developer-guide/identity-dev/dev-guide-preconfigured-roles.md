# Roles

OCS includes the following preconfigured roles:

- Tenant Member - Assigned to every user and client credential client. Users and clients issued with this role can generally access information pertaining to themselves.

- Tenant Administrator - The highest privilege role, with the ability to create new and remove existing users, clients, and secrets.
    **Caution:** OSIsoft advises against assigning this role to client credential clients.

<!--Angela Flores 6/18/21 - The Roles topic lists five preconfigured roles. Why is this topic different? Which one is correct? If the Roles topic exists, why is this one here? -->
