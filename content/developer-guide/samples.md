Code samples
=======

[CONNECT data services-Samples](https://github.com/AVEVA/AVEVA-Samples-CloudOperations) illustrates several ways for applications to interact with the CONNECT data services REST API.

The examples cover the basics of interacting with CONNECT data services, such as:

* Connecting to CONNECT data services
* Creating SdsTypes and instances of SdsStreams 
* Sending data to and retrieving data from SdsStreams 
* Performing queries against SdsStreams 
* Removing SdsStreams and SdsTypes

Currently, the samples are available in these languages:

* [.NET](https://github.com/AVEVA/sample-adh-waveform_libraries-dotnet) 
* [Java](https://github.com/AVEVA/sample-adh-waveform-java)
* [Python](https://github.com/AVEVA/sample-adh-waveform-python)
* [NodeJs](https://github.com/AVEVA/sample-adh-waveform-nodejs)
* [Angular](https://github.com/AVEVA/sample-adh-waveform-angular)

Because the examples are intended for demonstration purposes, they represent some example practices. The patterns may change as CONNECT data services continues to develop. Be sure to follow the [CONNECT data services-Samples](https://github.com/AVEVA/AVEVA-Samples-CloudOperations) repository on GitHub for updates.
