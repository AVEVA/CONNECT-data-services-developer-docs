1. On the `Community Administrators` page, choose the [roles](xref:ccRoles) that are assigned [community administration permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview).

    - To add new community administrator roles, select **Add Roles** and then select **Add Role** ![add role](../_icons/plus-thick-alt.svg) for any role that you want to function as community administrator.
    
	- To remove community administrator roles, select **Remove Role** ![remove role](../../_icons/remove-object.svg) for the role that you want to remove. 
    
	**Tip:** You can edit the default roles that are listed. For more information, see <xref:communities-manage-default-admins>.

1. After you finish, select **Next**.

1. On the `Community Members` page, add [Community Members](xref:ccRoles#community-member-role-preview), which are users within your tenant that have read access to the community and its data.
    
    To add new Community Members, select **Add Users** and then select **Add User** ![add user](../_icons/plus-thick-alt.svg) for each user that you want to add.
