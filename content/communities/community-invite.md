# Invite a tenant to a community

Invite other OCS tenants to join a community so they can share data. 

Administrators from both the tenant that owns the community and the tenant being invited must collaborate to complete this process:

- A community administrator from the tenant that owns the community (called the "inviter") invites another tenant by sending an email invitation to its tenant administrator.

- The tenant administrator from the invited tenant (called the "invitee") accepts the invitation on behalf of their tenant. 

**Invite process**
