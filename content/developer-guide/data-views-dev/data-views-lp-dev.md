# Data views

[!include[<title>](../../_includes/data-views.md)]

## Defining and refining a data view

There are several concepts and types used when defining data views. This is accomplished via the RESTful [data views API](xref:DataViewsAPIOverview). See the OCS documentation for greater detail on these concepts:

- [Define queries](xref:DataViewsQueries)
- [Define data field sets](xref:DataViewsFieldSets)
- [Group data items](xref:DataViewsGrouping)
- [Data view shape](xref:DataViewShape)

Data views are meant to be designed interactively. Each modification you make to a data view is likely to affect how the data view [resolves](xref:ResolvedDataView) into concrete information. The [resolved API resources](xref:ResolvedDataViewAPI) close the loop, showing you exactly what information is in the data view, and why.

Each data view can be individually [access-controlled](xref:DataViewsSecuringDataViews) using the [access control API resources](xref:DataViewsAccessControlAPI).

## Consuming a data view

[Data view data](xref:DataViewsQuickStartGetData) is available via queries to the RESTful data views [data API resource](xref:DataViewsDataAPI). 

To understand the source of each data field, inspect how the data view [resolved](xref:ResolvedDataView).
