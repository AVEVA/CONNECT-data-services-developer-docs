# Community setup

Establishing a new community requires collaboration between administrators for multiple tenants.

1. A tenant administrator creates a new community. During this process, the tenant adminstrator names the community and chooses which tenant users can participate in the community. This founding administrator is also known as *community owner*.

	For instructions on how to create a new community, see <xref:add-community>.

1. The community owner invites other tenants to participate in the community. The community owner sends email invitations to partnering tenant administrators, who then accepts the invitation and chooses which tenant users can participate in the community. Following acceptance, the community owner confirms the invitation, and the invitation process is complete.

	For instructions on how to complete the invitation process, see <xref:community-invite>.
