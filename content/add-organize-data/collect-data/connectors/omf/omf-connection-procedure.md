# Configure an OMF connection

You must configure an OMF connection to send OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) data to OCS. 

## Prerequisite

An OMF connection requires a client-credentials client.

## Procedure

To configure an OMF connection, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Collection** > **OMF Connections**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Connection**.

   The `Add OMF Connection` window appears.

1. In the `Add OMF Connection` window, complete the following fields, and then select **Next**:

   - **Name** - Enter a name for the OMF connection.

   - **Description** - (Optional) Enter a description for the connection.

1. In the **Clients** tab, select each client that can be used in the connection from the **Available** list to add it to the **Selected** list. 

1. Select **Next**.

1. In the **Namespaces** tab, verify that the namespace where you want write data appears in the **Selected** list, and then select **Next**.
   
1. In the **Review** tab, verify that the information is correct, and then select **Save**.  

An application can now use the selected client-credentials client to write OMF data to the specified namespace.
