# Groups

Groups allow you to assign and manage roles for groups of users.

## Prerequisite
 
You must have the role of Tenant Administrator to add and manage groups.

## Add a group

To add a group:

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Groups**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Group**.

1. Select an Identity Provider from the dropdown list that supports groups, such as Azure Active Directory.

1. Begin entering text in the `Name` field to search for an existing group and select the group you wish to add for access to assets, resources and services.

1. Specify the roles to assign to this new group.

1. Select **Add**.

## Manage group roles

To manage the roles for a group:

1. Select the group from the list.

1. Select **Manage Roles** in the Roles tab.

1. Select the roles you want to assign to the group.

1. Select **Save**.

## Remove a group

Removing a group does not remove it from the identity provider. Instead, the group no longer has any role mappings, cannot be given access to assets, resources and services, and will not be displayed in the list of groups on the `Groups` page.

To remove a group:

1. Select a group from the list.

1. Select **Remove Group**.

1. To confirm that you want to remove the group, select **Remove** in the message window or select **Cancel** to cancel the request.
