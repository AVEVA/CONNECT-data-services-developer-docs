## Remove an agent from the OCS portal

You remove an unneeded agent on the PI to OCS Agents page. Removing an agent removes all client and connection information from the OCS portal. 

â€‹	**Note:** You still need to [uninstall the PI to OCS Agent](xref:remove-agent) on the host computer to remove the agent software from that machine.

1. Log on to the [OCS portal](https://cloud.osisoft.com).
2. Click the menu ![ ](../..\images\waffle-button.png) icon, then click **Data Collection > PI to OCS Agents**.

3. In the `PI to OCS Agents` window, select an agent in the list.

4. Click the **Remove Agent** button above the list of agents.

   **Result:** The **Remove Agent** dialog box opens.

5. Click **Remove**.

   **Result:** The agent is removed from the list and deleted from OCS.
