# Manage permissions for Data Hub

As an administrator, you manage user permissions in both AVEVA Connect and AVEVA Data Hub to control what actions group members can perform in Data Hub. You begin in Connect by creating groups and assigning roles. Once you have created groups, added users, and assigned roles, you can map a group to a Data Hub role.
