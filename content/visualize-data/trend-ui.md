# Trend page

Use the `Trend` page to show data from assets and streams in a graphical format that traces the data over a specified period of time. Use trace data in a trend to monitor assets, anticipate problems, and proactively perform preventative maintenance. Display traces in a trend to better understand the data and gather useful information from it.

The following image shows the important elements of the `Trend` page, and the table below describes how to use these elements. For more information on how to use the `Trend` page to analyze traces, see [View trend data](xref:CreateTrendSession).
