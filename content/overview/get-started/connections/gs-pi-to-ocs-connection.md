# Get started with PI to OCS connections

Before you set up your PI to OCS connection, see [PI System best practices](xref:bpPISystemConnection) for recommendations regarding the PI OCS Agent.

To use PI to OCS to transfer data from your PI System to OCS, you must complete the following:

- Create and set up a PI System connection.
- Install the PI to OCS Agent.
- Create a data transfer.

Prerequisite: The exercise below assumes that your organization has a PI System with default PI points (for example, sinusoid) stored on PI Data Archive.

## Create and set up a PI System connection

1.  Click the ![Menu icon](images\menu-icon.png) icon, and then click **Connections** (under Data Management).

1.  From the **Namespace** drop-down list, click **MyOCS**.

1.  From the **Type** drop-down list, click **PI System**.

1.  Click **Add Connection**.

    The `Add PI System Connection` window opens.

1.  In the `Name` field, type **MyOCS**. Click **Next.**

1.  On the **Review** tab, verify that the `Source` field displays *Not Configured*, and the `Destination` field displays *MyOCS*. Click **Save**.

The `Download Installation Kit` window opens. Follow the prompts to download the PI to OCS Agent Installation Kit.

1.  Follow the prompts to download the PI to OCS Agent Installation Kit.

2.  In the `Connections` page, select the **MyOCS** connection.

    **Tip:** Click **Manage Permissions** to open the `Manage Permissions` window. When you are done, click **Cancel**.

    **Note:** In this window, you only configure permissions on the connection object itself.

    **Tip:** Click **Edit Connection** to open the `Edit` window.

    Use this window to edit the name and description of the connection. Enter the new name **MyOCSEdit** and description **PI System Connection used by My OCS**. Click **Next**. When you are done, click **Save**.

## Install the PI to OCS Agent

1. In the `Details` pane on the right side, click **Getting Started Guide** to open the _PI to OCS User Guide_. Follow the installation instructions in the Install the PI to OCS Agent topic.

## Create a data transfer

1.  Once the PI to OCS Agent is installed and registered, return to the `Connections` page of the OCS portal.
2.  Select the **MyOCS** connection in the list on the left, and then click **Add PI Point Transfer** in the right pane.
3.  In the `Add PI Point Transfer`window, in the `Name` field, type **sinusoid**. Click **Search**.
4.  Select the **sinusoid** PI point from the **PI Points Found** list, and click **Add**.

    The sinuisoid PI point appears in the **PI Points to Transfer** list.

5.  Click **Add Transfer** to create the transfer.

    A `Data Transfer` panel appears in the `Details` pane. After some time, the `Historical Transfer` field displays *100%*, and a new stream with sinusoid data is created in the Sequential Data Store.

6.  To verify the result, open the `Sequential Data Store Streams` page in OCS
    [here](https://cloud.osisoft.com/data/streams), and look for the sinusoid stream.

7.  Select it, and click **Data** on the tree in the left pane.

    If the PI to OCS Agent has transferred historical data, a value with a recent timestamp will display as the last stream value.

8.  Return to the `Connections` page.

9.  Select **MyOCSEdit** in the list, and click **Stop** to end the data transfer.

    **Note:** Connections cannot be deleted while a transfer is running.

If you have not already completed [Get started with OMF connections](xref:gsOMF), do this next. Otherwise, continue with [Get started with types](xref:gsTypes).
