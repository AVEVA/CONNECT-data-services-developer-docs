# Edit a transfer

You can edit saved transfer settings and add or remove AF elements and/or PI points with Edit Mode.

**Note:** Your transfer settings affect whether streams and data get replicated or deleted from cloud storage after you have removed elements or explicit PI points from your transfer. See [Name the transfer and set data privacy settings](xref:transfer-data) for details.

<!-- VTT: Add note about how the Opt-in setting (Transfer Settings window) affects streams/assets being deleted from cloud storage or replicated, depnding on the client's preference/option selection.-->
