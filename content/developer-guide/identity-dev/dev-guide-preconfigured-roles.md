# Roles

OSIsoft provides two preconfigured roles:

- Tenant Member - assigned to every user and client credential client. Users and clients issued with this role can generally access information pertaining to themselves.
- Tenant Administrator - the highest privilege role, with the ability to create new and remove existing users, clients and secrets. OSIsoft advises against assigning this role to client credential clients.
