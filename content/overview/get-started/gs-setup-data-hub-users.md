# Step 3: Set up AVEVA Data Hub groups, roles, and permissions

Add the groups that you just created in AVEVA Connect to AVEVA Data Hub, and then assign roles and permissions to your users.

## Step 3A: Log In to AVEVA Data Hub

From AVEVA Connect, log into AVEVA Data Hub. For instructions, see [Get started with AVEVA Data Hub](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/data-hub/page/overview/get-started/gs-overview.html).

## Step 3B: Map a user or group to an AVEVA Data Hub Role

Add the groups that you created in Connect to AVEVA Data Hub. While adding groups, you can assign them AVEVA Data Hub roles. For instructions, see [Map a group to an AVEVA Data Hub role](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/data-hub/page/overview/get-started/aveva-cnnxt/cnnxt-mgmt/manage-permissions/map-group-adh.html).

## Step 3C: Manage namespace permissions

Finally, assign permissions to each user role using the namespace permissions dialog. This dialog allows you to assign permissions to each group assigned to the folder; remember, the terms _folder_ and _namespace_ are synonymous.
