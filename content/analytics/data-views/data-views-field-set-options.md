# Field set options

A data view includes one or more data field sets, which are collections of data fields originating from the same query. A data field is a property or metadata from the streams or assets included in a query. One field serves as the index while others contain information related to the data items (streams or assets).

After adding your initial field sets in <xref:data-view-select-data-fields> When configuring a data view, you can configure the data field set for each query by choosing which data fields you want to include in the data view.

## Optional steps

After adding data fields to your field sets, you have the option to organize and group each field set with procedures outside of the configuration workflow. If you want to use these options, complete the applicable tasks below and then return to this configuration workflow to complete intial setup of a data view.
