# Write data

The SDS REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write SDS data. This section describes 
things to note when writing to an SdsStream.

When working in .NET, convenient SDS Client libraries are available. The `ISdsDataService` interface, accessed using the
``SdsService.GetDataService()`` helper, defines the available functions.

All writes rely on a streamâ€™s key or primary index. The primary index determines the order of events in the stream. Secondary indexes are updated, but they do not contribute 
to the request. All references to indexes are to the primary index.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the ISO 8601 representation of dates and times in SDS, `2020-02-20T08:30:00-08:00` for February 20, 2020 at 8:30 AM PST, for example.
SDS returns timestamps in UTC if the timestamp is of property `DateTime` and in local time if it is of `DateTimeOffset`. 

## Single stream writes   

The following methods support writing a single or multiple values:
* [Insert Values](xref:sdsWritingDataApi#insert-values) inserts a collection of events.
* [Patch Values](xref:sdsWritingDataApi#patch-values) updates specific fields for a collection of events.
* [Replace Values](xref:sdsWritingDataApi#replace-values) replaces a collection of events.
* [Remove Values](xref:sdsWritingDataApi#remove-values) deletes the events based on the request parameters.
* [Update Values](xref:sdsWritingDataApi#update-values) add or replaces a collection of events.

<!--removing per Chris' feedback
The base URI for writing SDS data to a single stream is:
 ```text
      api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams/{streamId}/Data  
 ```

### Parameters
``string tenantId``  
The tenant identifier  

``string namespaceId``  
The namespace identifier  

``string streamId``  
The stream identifier  
-->
### Request body format
With the exception of Remove Values, all single stream write calls require a request body containing the events to insert or modify.

The events must be formatted as a serialized JSON array of the stream's type. JSON arrays are comma-delimited lists of a type enclosed within square brackets. The following code shows a list of three WaveData events that are properly formatted for insertion. See the [OCS-Samples](https://github.com/osisoft/OCS-Samples) for the complete example.

You can serialize your data using one of many available JSON serializers available at [Introducing JSON](http://json.org/index.html). 



## Response format
Supported response formats include JSON, verbose JSON, and SDS. 

The default response format for SDS is JSON, which is used in all examples in this document. 
Default JSON responses do not include any values that are equal to the default value for their type.

Verbose JSON responses include all values in the returned JSON payload, including defaults.
To specify verbose JSON return, add the header ``Accept-Verbosity`` with a value of ``verbose`` to the request. 

Verbose has no impact on writes; writes return only error messages.

To specify SDS format, set the ``Accept`` header in the request to ``application/sds``.

## Indexes
Writing to the SDS relies on the primary index for positioning within the streams and locating existing events. 
Most writes use the index as specified by the value. Deletes are the exception to this rule. When deleting, 
indexes are specified as strings in the URI, or, when using the SDS Client Libraries, the index may be 
passed as-is to DELETE methods that take the index type as a generic argument. For more information on working 
with indexes, see [Indexes](xref:sdsIndexes). For information on compound indexes, see [Compound indexes](xref:sdsIndexes#compound-indexes).
