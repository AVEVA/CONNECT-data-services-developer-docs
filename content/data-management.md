# Data management

The Data Management menu provides a number of tools for managing your data within OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS):

* Use the `Namespaces` page to add, edit or remove namespaces from the tenant.

* Use the `Sequential Data Store` (SDS) to store, retrieve, and organize any type of streaming data.

* Use the `Communities` feature to create a private group to share data streams with external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers.

* Use `Stream Metadata Rules` to identify metadata such as location, asset class, and asset ID in stream names, then assign that defined metadata to all streams in a given namespace matching the stream name pattern.

* Use `Asset Rules` to identify patterns in a stream name and use this information to automatically create assets.
