# Manage queries

Following initial configuration of a data view, you can go back to add new queries to it or remove existing ones.

## Manage queries for a data view

Following initial addition of a data view, you can add queries or remove them from a data view by managing its queries.

1. In the left pane, select **Analytics** > **Data Views**.

1. Select the data view that includes the queries that you want to manage.

1. Select **Edit Data View**.

	**Getting `Unknown Community`?** This message indicates that the community has at least one query that you have insufficient permissions to edit and save. You must be a member of the community to edit and save the query or retrieve its data. However, you can still edit other queries in the data view that you have permissions for. To edit and save the inaccessible query, request that a community administrator add you to the community. For more information, see <xref:community-manage-users>.

	The data view opens.

1. Select **Manage Queries**.

## Add queries to a data view

You can add new queries to a data view the same way that you added one during initial data view creation and configuration. For more information on adding a new query to a data view, see <xref:data-views-add-query>.
