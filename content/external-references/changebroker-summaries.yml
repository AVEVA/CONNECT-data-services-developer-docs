get-signup:
  type: markdown
  value: |
    Retrieves a signup by signup identifier.
    
    **Notes:** Each signup includes a ``SignupState`` that describes its current status.
    To set your signup to a ``SignupState`` of 'Active', you must invoke the 'Get Signup' route 
    while the ``SignupState`` is 'Activating'. This route can only activate your signup after 
    the background setup process completes, so retries may be required if the signup response is 
    still in a ``SignupState`` of 'Activating'. 
    
    All ``SignupState``s are accompanied by a separate property of ``ModifiedDate``, which indicates 
    the date and time of the most recent modification to the signup, such as changing its properties 
    by invoking the 'Update Signup' route, updating a signup's resource subscriptions, or when the 
    signup's ``SignupState`` changes.

    Based on the returned ``SignupState`` value, the response may include additional properties, which are described below:
    - **Activating**: Includes an empty ``Bookmark``.
    
    - **Active**: Includes an encoded ``Bookmark`` that can be used to retrieve change data updates from subscribed resources.
    
    - **Expired**: Includes an empty ``Bookmark`` and an additional ``ExpiredDate`` timestamp. Expired signups cannot be reactivated.
