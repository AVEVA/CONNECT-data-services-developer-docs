# Manage permissions for Data Hub

As an administrator, you manage permissions in AVEVA Connect to control what actions users can perform in Data Hub. You start in Connect by creating groups and assigning roles. Once you have created groups, added users, and assigned roles, you can map a group to a Data Hub role and/or user.
