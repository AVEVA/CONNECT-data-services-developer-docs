# Share a view of your fleet

You may have many hundreds or even thousands of assets in your fleet. Working with colleagues on different computers and in different locations, you need to look at the same set of assets. The asset explorer allows you to filter and view a subset of the assets and share this view with others. 

## Procedure

1. Click the ![Menu icon](images/menu.png) icon and click **Asset Explorer** under Visualization.

1. Verify that the **Assets/Asset Type** selector is set to **Assets**.

1. Enter a string in the **Search** box to filter the assets that are displayed.

1. To copy the URL to the clipboard, click the ![link](images/share-icon.png) icon in the toolbar. 

   Send this link to your colleagues and partners. When they paste this URL into a browser, they will see the fleet view you captured in the link.

   **Tip:** Bookmark this link so you can easily return to this fleet view.
