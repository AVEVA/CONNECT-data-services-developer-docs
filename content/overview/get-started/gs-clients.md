# Get started with clients

Clients provide a way for users or applications to authenticate against OCS from applications other than the portal. OCS supports different client types, each of which support different types of applications:
<!--Jason Ames 12/13/21 Since we haven't otherwise listed the names of the client types, I'd prefer to leave the bullets in here even though the links are redundant to the Related Links.-->

- [Client-credentials clients](xref:gsClientCredentialsClients)

- [Authorization code clients](xref:gsAuthorizationCodeClients)

- [Hybrid clients](xref:gsHybridClients)

You can start with any of the clients and progress to the other two. 

## Next step

Continue with [Get started with assets](xref:gsAssets).
<!--Jason Ames 12/13/21 If they follow this next step, they're skipping the child topics for setting up clients. The topic gs-connections is similar and has no next step, while its child topics include the next step. If this were done in the same way we'd remove this next step section and change each of the child topic next steps to be "Continue with either of the following... When all three are complete, continue with Get started with assets."-->
