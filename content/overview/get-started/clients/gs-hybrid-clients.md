# Get started with hybrid clients

Hybrid clients are used by native and server-side web applications. Authentication can be performed using any supported browser. The server-side code retrieves an access token and a refresh token can also be provided. See the following topics for more information about hybrid clients:

- [Introduction to hybrid clients](xref:ccClients#hybrid-client)

- [Hybrid client PI Server counterpart](xref:ccClients#hybrid-client-pi-server)

- [Hybrid client best practices](xref:ccClients#hybrid-client-bp)

## Create a hybrid client

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Clients**.

1. From the **Client Type** dropdown list, select **Hybrid**.

1. In the toolbar, click **Add Client**.

1. Enter a name for the client.  

   Use this name to identify the application that will use this client.

1. (Optional) Select the **Allow Refresh Token** check box if the application uses refresh tokens to keep users logged in to AVEVAâ„¢ Data Hub.
   
   **Note:** Avoid selecting this option if there is no need to refresh tokens. There is a long lifespan for requesting new access tokens. 

1. Enter the URLs in the **Allowed Redirect URL(s)** text box, then click **+** to add it to the list.  
   
   The application specifies one of the URLs in this list during authentication, and AVEVA Data Hub returns the results of the authentication to this URL.

1. (Optional) Enter URLs in the **Allowed Logout Redirect URL(s)** text box, and click **+** to add it to the list.  
   
   This is similar to the **Allowed Redirect URL(s)**. The application specifies one of the URLs from this list when it logs a user out of Data Hub, and the Data Hub identity server sends the user to that URL after a successful log out.

1. (Optional) Set the **Token Lifetime**.  
   
   Token Lifetime represents the length of time in seconds the access token is valid before it expires. The default, 3600 seconds (one hour), is the maximum length of time. The minimum value is 60 seconds.

1. Select **Add**.  

1. In the `Add Secret` window, enter a description for the secret. Include a unique description if you plan to create multiple secrets.

1.	Enter an expiration date.

    Choose an expiration date that is appropriate for your use case. By default, the secret is set to expire one year after creation. You may specify that the secret does not expire by selecting the **Never Expires** checkbox. Secrets can be deleted later, including secrets that are set to never expire.

1.	Select **Add**.
   
    The **Client Successfully Created** window opens and displays the client Id and client secret Id.

    **Important:** Select the **Copy** buttons to the right of the **Client Id** and **Client Secret** fields to save a copy of these Ids for your records. You will need to reference these Ids in your applications. Once the window is closed, the client secret cannot be accessed or retrieved.

1.	Select **Close**.

    **Note:** The client ID is visible on the client. If you did not save the client secret, select the client in the list and use the Details pane to remove the old secret and add a new secret. Client modifications may take up to an hour before being visibly updated.
