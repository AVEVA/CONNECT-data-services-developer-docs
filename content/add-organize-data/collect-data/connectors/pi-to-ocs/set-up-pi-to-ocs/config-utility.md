# Run the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility

Use the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility to configure your PI Data Archive server connection settings before creating a transfer and after an agent upgrade. You can use the utility to change a data source, view connection details, add PI mappings, and set data privacy settings.

## Add a PI Data Archive

You must add and configure the source PI Data Archive you want to transfer on-prem data from to OCS. If you are upgrading an agent, the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility maintains the previously selected PI Data Archive configuration.

#### Before you begin

Install the [PI to OCS Agent](xref:install-agent). To open the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility, click the **Windows** menu button, then click **OSIsoft > PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility**.

### Procedure

1. Click the ![](../../images/pda-source-icon.png) button in the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility.
   
   ![](../../images/config-utility-screen-01.png)
   
2. Enter the name of the source PI Data Archive in the text box, then click **Add Server**.

   **Result:** After successful detection, the PI Data Archive connection is added and you are advanced to the next page of the utility.

3. Review the following details for your PI Data Archive:
   * Server name, version, and server ID
   * IP address
   * PI mapping (see [Create a PI mapping](#create-a-pi-mapping) for more information)
   * Connection status and timeout

4. **Optional:** Click the pencil icon next to the **Connection Timeout (sec)** text box to change the length of time the agent checks for a server connection before timing out.

5. **Optional**: Click the **Test Connection** button to confirm that the connection to the Data Archive is working.

6. **Optional**: Click the **Remove Server** button to remove the configured PI Data Archive from the PI to OCS connection.

7. Click **Save** to finish adding and saving the source PI Data Archive configuration settings.

8. **Optional:** If you are finished, click **Exit**.

   **Note:** You must click **Save** to save your PI Data Archive connection settings.  

## Create a PI mapping 

PI mappings enable access to data stored on a PI Data Archive by service accounts assigned to a PI identity.  PI mappings are created for a PI identity, user or group. Accounts assigned to a PI identity can read and transfer PI point data to OCS. See ["What are PI identities and mappings?"](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/pi-server/page/what-are-pi-identities-and-mappings_new.html) for more information. The following applies to PI mappings:

* The user account used to launch the utility must have permissions to create mappings.
* You can edit mappings.

#### Procedure

1. In the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility, click the pencil icon next to the **PI Mapping** field to open the **Configure Mapping** dialog box.

   ![Configure Mapping dialog box](../../images/configure-mapping-db.png)

2. Select an identity for the PI mapping under Identity.
3. Click **Edit**.

   **Result:** The PI mapping is created for the selected identity, group or user.

   **Note:** If a PI mapping has already been created with another tool, a warning is displayed. 
4. Click **Close** to return to the utility, then click **Save**.

## Set data privacy and add an agent description

You can set data privacy settings and assign a descriptive name to an agent. Data privacy settings let you control wether a PI Data Archive host name is displayed in the OCS portal. If you opt to have a host name published, it appears on the PI to OCS Agents window as shown in the screen capture below.

![](../../images/pi-to-ocs-agents-hostname.png)

**Note:**  By default, host names are not published.

#### Procedure

1. In the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility, click the pencil icon to the right of the **Agent Service Account** field.
   **Result:** The `PI to OCS Agent Settings` dialog box opens.

2. To have your PI to OCS Agent's hostname visible and displayed in OCS on the PI to OCS Agent page, select the **Opt-in to publishing PI to OCS Agent Hostname in OCS?** option.

3. **Optional:** Enter a descriptive name for the agent In the **PI to OCS Agent Description** text box.

4. Click **Ok** to save your selections, then click **Save** in the utility.

## List of agent status states

It may take a few minutes for your PI System to be registered. The following states may appear under the Agent Status field in the PI to OCS Configuration Utility to indicate a connection issue.

| **State**                     | **Description**                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data  Source Connection Issue | Indicates  the PI To OCS Agent isn’t able to connect to the PI Data Archive. Some  reasons for this status include the PI Data Archive is turned off, a firewall  issue is preventing connections or an incorrect name is configured for the  Data Archive (for example, trying to connect to a machine that doesn’t  exist/was renamed). There may be additional reasons for this status. |
| Data  Source Security Issue   | Indicates  the PI Data Archive connection is unsecure and security settings need to be  addressed. |
| Missing Configuration         | The PI Data Archive server or AF server has not been configured in the PI to OCS Agent. |
| Registration Failed           | Contact OSIsoft Customer support for assistance.             |
| Registering                   | The PI to OCS Cloud portion is creating the necessary resources for your PI to OCS Agent. |
| Shutdown                      | The last communication that the PI to OCS Cloud had with the agent was a shutdown message. |

## Access the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility

You can open the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility to change server connections and other settings after the initial setup. 

**Note:** If you're not the original user who installed the agent, the user account used needs to be authenticated in OCS before you can access the utility.

### Procedure

1. Click the Windows menu button.

2. On the Windows menu, scroll down and click **OSIsoft > PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility**, then click **Yes**. 

   **Result:** Upon successful authentication, the **PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility** opens.

   **Note:** If you have not yet added a PI Data Archive server, see [Add a PI Data Archive](#add-a-pi-data-archive) for instructions.
