# Manage edge system configurations

You can import an edge system configuration from the field to its corresponding edge system digital twin as a record. You can also create a new configuration, using a default configuration or a configuration template. Once the configuration is complete, you can export the configuration file for each component or for the edge system to manually apply to the edge system. You can use an exported configuration file to configure other edge systems by importing it. The maximum size for a configuration file is 16 MB.

Configuration is available for the following edge system types:

 - PI Adapter for Azure Event Hubs

 - PI Adapter for BACnet

 - PI Adapter for DNP3

 - Edge Data Store

 - Edge Data Store Module

 - PI Adapter for Modbus TCP

 - PI Adapter for MQTT

 - AVEVA Adapter for MQTT Module

 - PI Adapter for OPC UA

 - AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA Module

 - PI Adapter for RDBMS

 - PI Adapter for Structured Data Files

The `namespaceId` in the data and health endpoint URLs defaults to the namespace where the configuration template is created. For example, if the namespace of the configuration template is MyData, the endpoint URL would be `https://website.com/api/v1/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/MyData/Omf`.

An edge system appears on the `Software Management Edge Systems` page once it is writing health data to AVEVA Data Hub. For information on configuring health endpoints, see the specific edge system product documentation at [docs.aveva.com](https://docs.aveva.com/).

For edge systems, use mustache tokens, in the format `{{SecretA}}`, to denote secrets in configuration files. Secrets are managed using clients. The token name must match an Edge Management System property defined for the edge system. Tokens must be used in fields where `isEncrypted=true`. After deploying the configuration to the device, you must manually update the configuration on the device with the secret.

For edge modules, use variables, in the format `{{VariableA}}`, to denote secrets in configuration files. The variable is associated with a secret in AVEVA Edge Management.

## Import an edge system configuration

To import an edge system configuration from the field to the corresponding edge system digital twin:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Collection** > **Software Management**.

1. Verify that the **Edge Systems/Configuration Templates** selector is set to **Edge Systems**.

1. Find and select the edge device to configure.

1. Select **Edit Edge System**.

1. Select **Import Configuration**.

1. In the `Import Configuration` window, click **Select file**, browse to the configuration file to import, and then select **Open**.

1. Select **Import**.

1. Review the imported file contents to ensure it is correct.

1. When you have finished, select **Save & Close**.

1. To confirm the changes, select **Save & Close**.

## Edit an edge system configuration

To edit an edge system configuration and export it for use:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Collection** > **Software Management**.

1. Verify that the **Edge Systems/Configuration Templates** selector is set to **Edge Systems**.

1. Find and select the edge device to configure.

1. In the right pane, select **Edit Edge System** or ![Edit](../../../_icons/default/pencil.svg).

1. To manage the tags for an edge system, select **Add Tag** ![Add Tag](../../../_icons/default/plus.svg) and then do the following:

   - To add a tag, enter the tag text in the **New Tag** field and press Enter.

   - To delete a tag, select **X** in the tag bubble.

1. To create the configuration, do one of the following:

   - To use the default configuration for the edge system type, select **Start With Default**.

   - To select a JSON file that contains the configuration, select **Start With Default**.

1. (Optional) In the **Section Select** dropdown list, select the section of the configuration to modify. The default option of `JSON Configuration` shows the entire configuration.

1. Modify the JSON as needed. For configuration guidelines, refer to the specific edge system documentation.

   **WARNING:** Do not include secrets in the configuration. Secrets cannot be stored or exported in a configuration. 

   Errors in the JSON syntax are underlined. To see an explanation of the issue, hold the mouse over the underlined text. The overall status of the JSON syntax is displayed over the right pane.

1. To export the completed configuration, do one of the following:

   - To export just the selected section, select **Export Section** in the right pane.

   - To export the entire configuration in one file, select **Export Configuration**.

   The JSON file is downloaded to your browser.

1. When you have finished, select **Save & Close**.

1. To confirm the changes, select **Save & Close**.
