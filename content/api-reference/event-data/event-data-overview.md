# Event data overview

You can store and access event data and reference data in AVEVA Data Hub.

The event type store APIs allow you to set up the event types, reference data types, and enumerations for this data. These types are converted into a GraphQL schema.

The event GraphQL API allow you to execute a query or mutation on the event data.
