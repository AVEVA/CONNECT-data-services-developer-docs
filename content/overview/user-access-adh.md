# Overview of user and access management

As the AVEVA™ Data Hub administrator, you set up users and control access to AVEVA™ Data Hub in AVEVA™ Connect. The following administrative tasks must be performed in AVEVA™ Connect before users or groups can use AVEVA™ Data Hub:

- Subscribe to the AVEVA™ Data Hub service
 
- Create a folder and turn on the AVEVA™ Data Hub service

- Create new groups and assign roles

- Map a group to an AVEVA™ Data Hub role

- Add and assign users to groups

When a capability role is assigned to a group, all of the users in that group will be able to see the appropriate capability launch tile on their home page in AVEVA™ Connect. [Should this sentence be reworded or moved?]

**Question for AVEVA™ Connect SME reviewer:** Should admin tasks be performed in the order they appear in the Connect User Guide? ((1) Add users, (2) add groups, (3) create folders, (4) assign roles, and (5) assign users to groups?)
