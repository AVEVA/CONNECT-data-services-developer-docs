# Organize data

There are various ways to organize and simplify how you view data, as described in this section.

You can create asset definitions to help organize and visualize information about a particular asset, such as a truck or a mixing tank. For example, for an asset of this kind, you might define properties similar to the following information.

+ Metadata, such as make and model
+ Measurements, such as location or temperature
+ Status, such as online or inactive

Metadata rules enable you to specify a stream-name pattern based on stream names of interest. You can use this metadata rule to capture all streams in a given namespace that match the stream name pattern you defined.
To view a subset of data, you can create a data view by defining the target namespace, and then specifying the source stream or streams, selected data fields, time period, and interpolation interval.
You can also use stream views to define a view of a subset of data from one or more streams. For example, you can use a stream view to make it appear as if you have changed the SDS type on which the stream is based.
