# About roles

Roles are used to manage access to assets, resources, and services in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS). Roles are assigned to identities, which includes users, groups, and client-credentials clients. <!--- Josh Kim Mar19021: Similar to the comment as before where it seemed to me that this sentence implied roles were the primary factor in getting access, when in fact it is the roles of the users compared against the provisioned ACL that grants access. Do we want to communicate this? --->

There are five built-in roles which cannot be removed from a tenant.

- **Tenant Administrator** - OCS Administrator of OCS who is granted full permissions throughout OCS, by default. This is the highest privilege role, with the ability to create new and remove existing users, clients and secrets. OSIsoft recommends not assigning this role to clients.
- **Tenant Contributor** - Granted read and write permissions throughout OCS, by default.
- **Tenant Data Steward** - No specific permissions are granted to this role, by default.
- **Tenant Viewer** - No specific permissions are granted to this role, by default.
- **Tenant Member** - This role is assigned to all users or clients in OCS. Tenant members are granted read access throughout OCS, by default.

In addition, you can create custom roles which are not granted any specific permissions, by default. 

Simply assigning a role to a user or client does not determine access. This is defined when a role is explicitly allowed or denied access to OCS resources through an access control list (ACL). An ACL is created for each OCS resource and it defines which roles have access to the resource. <!-- Josh: I think I'd like to keep the discussion about ACLs brief. Can you tell me if what I've said here is correct? -->
<!--- Josh Kim Mar19021: Perfect! --->

For any resource in OCS, permissions are allowed or denied for specific roles, rather than to specific users or clients. These permissions are managed using the **Manage Permissions** dialog for the given resource. Each role can be allowed or denied access to one or more of the following access types: **Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, and **Manage Permissions**.

You must have the **Tenant Administrator** role to add and manage roles in a tenant.

## <a name="roles-pi-core"></a>PI Core counterpart

Roles in OCS are comparable to PI identities in PI Data Archive or identities in PI AF server. Throughout OCS, permissions are granted to roles instead of directly to individual users or clients. This is similar to how identities in PI Core are used to assign permissions for a set of users or clients.

## <a name="roles-bp"></a>Roles best practices

The following best practices are recommended when you create and assign roles to users:

- Consider whether the read access granted by the Tenant Member role is acceptable for all users and clients in your tenant. Specifically, if you plan to invite users from outside your organization, you may want to limit their read access. One way to do this is to create a custom role for external users so that their permissions can be explicitly managed.

- Use caution when granting the Tenant Administrator role. OSIsoft recommends that you assign a different role to users and clients who should not manage permissions. OSIsoft recommends that you avoid assigning the Tenant Administrator role to client-credentials clients.

- Ensure that the roles assigned to client-credentials clients only grant the minimum set of permissions required by the application that uses these clients. This minimizes the potential damage in the event a client secret is compromised or a problem arises with the application.

- Use caution when denying permissions because this supersedes any allowed access to a role. For example, if a user is allowed write access through one role but is denied write access through another role, the user will not have write access. Because all users and clients are assigned the Tenant Member role, you cannot deny permissions to the **Tenant Member** role. Doing so would deny the given permission to every user in the tenant.
