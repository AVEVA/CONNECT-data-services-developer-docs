    Stream metadata is represented as a dictionary of string keys and associated string values. 
    It can be used to associate additional information with a stream. Stream tags are represented 
    as a list of strings. Tags can be used to categorize or denote special attributes of streams. 
    The Stream Metadata API And Stream Tags API do not accept the search query parameter in their respective
    GET methods. However, stream tags and metadata can be used as criteria in search query strings to return 
    stream results with the [Streams](xref:sds-streams) API.
