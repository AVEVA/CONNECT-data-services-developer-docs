  value: |
    Stream metadata is represented as a dictionary of string keys and associated string values. 
    It can be used to associate additional information with a stream. Stream tags are represented 
    as a list of strings. Tags can be used to categorize or denote special attributes of streams. 
    The Stream Metadata API And Stream Tags API do not accept the search query parameter in their respective
    GET methods. However, stream tags and metadata can be used as criteria in search query strings to return 
    stream results with the [Streams](xref:sds-streams) API.

    A <see cref="Dto.Namespace"/> is a logical unit of organization for data within a tenant.
    It is a collection of types, streams, and stream views. Each tenant may contain more than one namespace.
    Before you can put any data into OCS for a given tenant, a namespace must be created within the scope of that tenant.
    Namespace identifiers are unique within an account.
    A namespace is a collection of SDS types, streams, and stream views. Namespace identifiers are unique within a tenant. Requirements for namespace identifiers must meet the following critieria:
    
    - Must be 1-100 characters in length
        
    - Must only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, spaces, and periods 
    
    - Must not contain two consecutive periods

    - Must not start or end with a period

    - Must not start with two consecutive underscores
    
    In practice, namespaces may correspond to a specific set of infrastructure assets, but more commonly correspond
    to virtual partitions within a single set of assets. You can create one or more namespaces within a tenant.
    Each namespace is effectively an instance of SDS, within which you create types and streams, stream views, data views, and metadata.
