# Collect data

OCS provides the following methods to collect data. You can ingress data from an external application or from PI Server directly to OCS:

* Use PI to OCS to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to OCS. 
   * PI to OCS maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.
* Use OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) to pass JSON messages to OCS using an HTTP client. 
   * OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into OCS.
