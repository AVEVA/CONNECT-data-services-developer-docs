## Sign out of AVEVA Connect

Some AVEVA Connect application environments are independent of each other. To switch between application environments you should sign out before attempting to sign in to another application.

When you have completed your session within AVEVA Connect, you must sign out. To sign out, select ![account-circle](../../../_icons/default/account-circle.svg) > **Sign Out**.
