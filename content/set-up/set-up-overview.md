# Manage users and permissions in AVEVA Data Hub

You can customize the AVEVA Data Hub environment to meet your organization's requirements and needs. As an administrator, you use AVEVA Connect to manage namespaces, add groups, add new users by email address, and assign users to roles. You then add these existing users and groups to AVEVA Data Hub to further enable access to assets, resources, and services.
