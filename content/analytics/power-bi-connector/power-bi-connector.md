# Power BI Connector

The AVEVA Data Hub Power BI Connector retrieves data views from AVEVA Data Hub and makes them available in Microsoft Power BI for advanced data visualization and analysis. You can also use Microsoft Power BI to edit the query generated from the connector to modify the dates, edit the interpolation interval, and enable an incremental refresh of data.
