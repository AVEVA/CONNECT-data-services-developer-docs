# Install the PI to OCS Agent

When you install the PI to OCS Agent, make sure to follow these guidelines:

* Install the agent on a host computer separate from your PI Server deployment.

* Use a domain account that has been granted Administrator privileges on a computer registered to the same domain.

* Enable read access to Data Archive security tables and the PI points and data to be transferred.

* Enable read access to the AF server elements and attributes to be transferred.

You can download the PI to OCS Agent from the PI to OCS Agents page on the portal and then transfer it to the computer that will host the agent.

**Note:** The PI to OCS Agent installation cannot be completed if the system time is not correct. Additionally, you will not be able to complete the PI to OCS Agent installation if Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled. For more information, see [Disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](xref:disable-ie-security). 

## Configure access to PI Data Archive Security tables, PI point data, and optional AF server

* Archive data (PIARCDATA Security table)

* The PI points configuration table (PIPOINT Security table)

* The PI points and data to be transferred

* The AF server elements and attributes to be transferred
