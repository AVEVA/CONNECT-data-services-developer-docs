# Organize data

OCS includes various ways to organize and simplify how you view data. You can create asset definitions to help organize and visualize information about a particular asset, such as a truck or a mixing tank. As an example, you might want to create the following information:

+ Metadata, such as make and model
+ Measurements, such as location or temperature
+ Status, such as online or inactive

Use metadata rules to specify a stream-name pattern based on stream names of interest. Then use this metadata rule to capture all streams in a given namespace that match the stream name pattern you defined. To view a subset of data, you can create a data view for a target namespace, and then specify the source streams, data fields, time period, and interpolation interval. You can also use stream views to define a view of a subset of data from one or more streams. For example, you can use a stream view to make it appear as if you have changed the SDS type on which the stream is based.
