There are two primary means of controlling how the data items are organized: 

- One or more field may be designated to *group* the data view, effectively grouping or partitioning the data items on some value.

- Within a set of fields, one field may be designated to *identify* or align the items.

Data view data is available in several formats, including JSON and CSV, with a user-specified range and granularity. Data is obtained by querying the REST API.
