# Rules

You can create rules for both metadata and assets in OCS.

A metadata rule is a user-defined stream name pattern in which each part is assigned a metadata type. Metadata rules capture any streams currently stored in an OCS namespace, as well as matching streams that are subsequently added to the namespace. Metadata rules are created in the OCS portal to help simplify the process of assigning metadata to streams.

The asset rules API allows you to programmatically create, read, update, and delete asset rules.
