# Groups

Groups allow you to assign and manage roles for groups of users.
	
You must have the role of Tenant Administrator to add and manage groups.

## Add a group

To add a group, take the following steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Groups**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Group**.

1. Begin entering text in the Name field to search for an existing group and then select the group you wish to add for access to assets, resources and services.

1. Specify the roles to assign to this new group.

1. Select **Add**.

## Manage group roles

To manage the roles for a group, take the following steps:

1. Select the group from the list.

1. Select **Manage Roles** in the **Roles** tab.

1. Select the roles you want to assign to the group.

1. Select **Save**.

## Remove a group

To remove a group, take the following steps:

1. Select a group from the list.

1. Select **Remove Group**.

1. Confirm that you want to remove the group in the message window by selecting **Remove** or select **Cancel** to cancel the request.
	
Removing a group does not remove it from the identity provider. Instead, the group no longer has any role mappings, cannot be given access to assets, resources and services, and will not be displayed in the list of groups on the `Groups` page.
