# Asset explorer

Use the asset explorer to create assets, then visualize data streams and properties to troubleshoot and analyze the associated devices. You can create assets as needed, create them from an asset type, which acts as a template for creating similar assets, and generate them based on stream naming patterns using asset rules.
