    **Result:** The existing groups are listed.

3.	Click **+ Add group**. 
 
    **Result:** The **Add group** area is displayed.

4.	Enter the required group name in the **Group name** field.

5.	Enter a description for the group in the **Group description** field.

6.	Optional: Select the required users to add to this group. 

7.	Click Save.
 
    **Result:** The group is created, and the specified users are added to the group.
