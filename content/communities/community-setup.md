# Community setup

Establish a community by creating it and then inviting your trusted business partners to join from their tenant. Each invitation is a three-way handshake where one tenant sends an invitation, the invited tenant accepts, and then the original tenant confirms that the expected tenant accepted.

- Communities use special user roles to safely and securely share data among tenants. Learning more about these roles is recommended before creating or joining a community. For more information, see <xref:community-community-roles>. 

- For instructions on how to create a new community, invite other tenants to it, and then confirm the invitations, see <xref:community-workflow-create>.

- For instructions on how to join a community by accepting an email invitation, see <xref:community-workflow-join>.
