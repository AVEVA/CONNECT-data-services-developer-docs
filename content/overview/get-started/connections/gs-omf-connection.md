# Get started with OMF connections

To send Open Message Format (OMF) data to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub, you must first configure an OMF connection. For more information about OMF connections, see [OMF best practices](xref:bpOMFConnection).

Use this get started procedure to become familiar with OMF connections.

To create an OMF connection, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Clients**.

1. Verify that there is at least one client-credentials client to use in the OMF connection. If you need to create one, see [Clients](xref:ccClients).

1. In the left pane, select **Data Collection** > **OMF Connections**.

1. In the **Namespace** field, select `MyData`.

1. Select **Add Connection** to open the `Add OMF Connection` window.

1. In the **Name** field, enter *MyData* and select **Next**.

1. In the **Clients** tab, select a client in the `Available` list to add it to the `Selected` list. Select **Next**.

    **Note:** For the purposes of this exercise, you may choose any client.

1. In the **Namespaces** tab, verify that the `MyData` namespace appears in the `Selected` list, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Review** tab, verify that the `Clients` list shows the client-credentials client you chose, and the `Namespaces` list shows the `MyData` namespace. Select **Save**.

    An application can now use the selected client-credentials client to write OMF data to the `MyData` namespace.

1. To learn more about OMF connections, do the following:

  - Select **Manage Permissions** to open the `Manage Permissions` window.

     In this window, you configure permissions only on the connection object itself. Select **Cancel** to continue.

  - Select **Edit Connection** to open the `Edit` window.

     Use this window to edit the name and description of the connection. Enter the new name *MyDataEdit* and enter the description *OMF Connection used by MyData*. When you are done, select **Next** until you get to the **Review** tab, and then select **Save**.
