# Step 2: Set up AVEVA Connect users and groups

As a best practice, AVEVA recommends managing users and groups for AVEVA Data Hub primarily through AVEVA Connect. This step guides you through creation of users and assigning them to a group. Later, in Step 3: Set up AVEVA Data Hub groups, roles, and permissions, you will add these users and groups to AVEVA Data Hub.

## Step 2A: Add Users

Add the users that will use AVEVA Data Hub to AVEVA Connect. For instructions on completing this process, see [Add User (aveva.com)](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/aveva-connect/page/885607.html).

## Step 2B: Add Groups

As a best practice, AVEVA recommends managing users as groups, so you should create one or more groups to organize your users. For instructions, see [Add a Group (aveva.com)](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/aveva-connect/page/885624.html).

## Step 2C: Add Users to a Group

Place your users in the appropriate groups. For instructions, see [Add Users to a Group (aveva.com)](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/aveva-connect/page/885610.html).

## Step 2D: Assign Groups the Data Hub Viewer Role

Before you or any other user can log into Data Hub from Connect, you must first assign your user group the **DataHub Viewer** role in Connect. This role allows users to see the service tile within Connect that allows you to log into AVEVA Data Hub. For instructions, see [Assign roles to a group (aveva.com)](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/data-hub/page/overview/get-started/aveva-cnnxt/cnnxt-mgmt/manage-permissions/assign-roles-groups.html).
