# Data Views (Preview)

A data view is a user-selected subset of data stored in OSIsoft Cloud Services which is mapped into a customizable table format. A data view includes related data usually designed for use with a specific application or analysis. Data is selected using a query for one or more data items. A data item is an SdsStream. Each column in a data view is mapped to a property of one or more data items. Data items can optionally be organized into data groups within the data view in order for users to more easily compare similar properties in the same column of a data view.

This is a preview of the data view documentation. Improvements and additional information will be added in the near future.
