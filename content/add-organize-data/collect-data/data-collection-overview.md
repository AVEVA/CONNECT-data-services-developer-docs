# Collect data

Collect data from an external application or from PI Server directly to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub using the following methods:

* Use Data Hub to OCS to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub. 
  * Data Hub to OCS maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.
  * Data Hub to OCS transfers AF elements and attributes as AVEVA&trade; Data Hub assets and metadata and properties.
* Use Open Message Format (OMF) to pass JSON messages to OCS using an HTTP client. 
  * OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into AVEVA&trade; Data Hub.
