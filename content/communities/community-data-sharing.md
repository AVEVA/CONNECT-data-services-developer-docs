# Data sharing and viewing

After a community is established, users can share data streams with a community and tenants. Additionally, Community Members can view which data streams their tenant has shared or view which streams another tenant has shared.  

## Prerequisites to share and view data

- You must be a Community Member in the community where you want to share or view data. 

- To share data streams, you must be assigned the Share permission for the Sequential Data Store.

## Data sharing and viewing tasks

Community data sharing actions include:

- <xref:ShareStreams>

	Share a data stream with the community or unshare one.

- <xref:community-view-shared-streams>

	View which streams you or another tenant has shared within a community.

- <xref:community-view-shared-data>
