# Community setup

Establishing a new community requires collaboration between administrators for multiple tenants. Complete the following procedures to establish a new community and invite other tenants to join it.

**Tip:** Looking for instructions on how to join a community? See <xref:community-accept-invite>.

## Prerequisites for community setup

To create a new community, you must:

- Be a [Tenant Administrator](xref:ccRoles#tenant-roles).

- Have the email address for Tenant Administrator of the tenant that you invite to the community.

## Community setup outline

Complete the following procedures to start a new community and invite other tenants.

1. <xref:add-community>

	This procedure provides instruction on how to create a new community on any tenant. During this process, you name the community, choose which roles can administer it, and choose which users from your tenant can participate.

1. <xref:community-invite>

	This procedure provides instruction on how to invite other tenants to join your community. After sending an invitation, wait for the invited tenant to accept it. Once the invited tenant accepts, you can confirm the tenant's participation.

	After the invited tenant joins accepts the invitation, it must choose its own administration roles and users, much like the tenant owner. For more information on how to join a community following an invitation, see <xref:community-accept-invite>.

1. <xref:community-manage-sds-permissions>

	Regardless of whether you are creating or joining a community, you must manage permissions for data streams to allow user roles to share streams with the community.

	**Note:** You can be a [Community Administrator](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) rather than a Tenant Administrator to complete this procedure.
