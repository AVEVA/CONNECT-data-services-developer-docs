# Namespaces in AVEVA™ Connect

A namespace is a logical unit of organization for data within a tenant.  Each tenant may contain more than one namespace. Before AVEVA™ Data Hub can receive data for a given tenant, a namespace must exist for that tenant. When you turn on the AVEVA™ Data Hub service and set up a folder in AVEVA™ Connect, a namespace is created with the same folder name. To change the name of a namespace, you must rename the namespace folder name in AVEVA™ Connext.

For more information about namespaces, see the following topics:
