# Resource usage

The `Resource Usage` page provides visibility into the number of streams created and viewed in a customer tenant, as well as the total number of streams available under the current licensing agreement. This is a valuable metric that enables you to see streams actually used in relation to the number of streams licensed. Available stream usage data is presented in monthly increments, where the number for each month is the average of daily usage for the month.

To view the `Resource Usage` page, follow these steps:

1. Select the **User profile** icon ![Card view](images/profile-icon.png).

1. Select **Resource Usage**.

1. Click on the bar for any month in the graph to display daily stream usage data for each day recorded for that month.
