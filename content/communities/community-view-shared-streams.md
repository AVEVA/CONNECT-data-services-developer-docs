# View shared streams 

After a community is established, you can view which data streams are shared into it. You can view both the streams that your tenant is sharing, as well as the streams that other tenants are sharing. You can view shared data streams in one of two ways: from the `Communities` page or `Sequential Data Store`. Your access to view shared data stream information depends upon your assigned user roles and permissions.

## To view shared streams

You can view shared streams from both the `Communities` page and `Sequential Data Store`. Select one of the tabs for more information on how to view which data streams are shared.

## [Communities](#tab/communities)

From the `Communities` page **Tenants** tab, you can view which data streams each tenant has shared with the community.

1. From the left panel, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Browse to the applicable community and select **Details**.

    Details for the community open.

    **Note:** The **Streams** field usually displays the number of streams shared into the community, but you may encounter the following states:
            
    - If the **Info** ![Info](../_icons/branded/information.svg) icon displays, you cannot view the number of streams displayed because you are not a Community Member. For information on adding a user a Community Member, see <xref:community-manage-users>.
    
    - If the **Warning** ![Warning](../_icons/custom/alert.svg) icon displays, you are a Community Member, but there is an issue with stream permissions. For more information on setting stream permissions, see <xref:community-enable-stream-sharing-permissions>.
    
1. From the **Tenants** tab, select a tenant to view which streams that it shares with the community.

    Details for the community open in the right pane. 

1. From the right pane, select the **Streams** tab.

    The **Streams** tab lists each data stream that the tenant shares with the community. 

    **Tip:** Want to view more details about the shared streams? Select **More options** ![More options icon](../_icons/default/dots-vertical.svg) > **![Launch icon](../_icons/default/launch.svg) View Streams** to open it within `Sequential Data Store` in a new tab.

## [Sequential Data Store](#tab/sds)

When working from `Sequential Data Store`, you can view which data streams are shared within communities, sorting by either stream or community.

### View shared streams by community

1. From the left panel, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. If necessary, enable the **Filter Communities** panel by selecting the **Filter** icon ![Filter icon](../_icons/branded/filter.svg).

1. Select a community to filter for.

    The page is filtered to list only data streams shared in the selected communities.

### View communities for a shared stream

While viewing individual data streams in `Sequential Data Store`, you can view each community that the stream is shared with that you have read access to.

1. From the left panel, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. (Optional) Select one or more community to filter for.

1. Select a single data stream. Details for the community open in the right pane.

1. From the right pane, select the **Sharing** tab.

    The tab lists each community that the stream is shared to for which you have read access.  

    **Note:**  This tab does not list all communities that the stream is shared withâ€”only those that you have read access to.

    **Tip:** Want to view a community that the selected stream is shared to? Select the **Launch** icon ![Launch icon](../_icons/branded/launch.svg) for the community.
