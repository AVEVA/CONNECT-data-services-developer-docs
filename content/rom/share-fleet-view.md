# Share a view of your fleet

You may have many hundreds or even thousands of assets in your fleet. Working with colleagues on different computers and in different locations, you need to be looking at the same set of assets. The asset explorer allows you to filter and view a subset of the assets and share this view with others. 

Follow this procedure to filter and view a subset of assets:

1. In the left pane, select **Visualization** > **Asset Explorer**.

1. Verify that the **Assets/Asset Type** selector is set to **Assets**.

1. Enter a string in the **Search** box to filter the assets that are displayed.

1. Click the **Shared Filtered Assets** ![link](images/share-icon.png) icon in the toolbar to copy the URL to the clipboard. 

   **Note:** Send this link to your colleagues and partners. When they paste this URL into a browser, they will see the fleet view you created.

   **Tip:** Bookmark this link to return to this fleet view.
