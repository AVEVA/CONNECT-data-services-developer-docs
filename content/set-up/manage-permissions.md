# Manage permissions

You control what actions members of a role can perform on tenant resources in the `Manage Permissions` window. You assign users to roles to manage access to assets, resources, and services in a namespace.

Perform the following steps to manage role permissions in the AVEVA Data Hub portal.

1. Click the **Change Namespace** button in the upper right toolbar, then select the desired namespace.
 
   **Note:** Resource creators have complete access to the resource.   

1. Click the **Manage Permissions** ![](./images/manage-permissions.png) button in the upper-right toolbar.

   **Result:** The `Manage Permissions` window opens.

1. Select the **Selected Role** field, then choose a role from the dropdown list. 

1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Allow** option next to any action (**Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, **Manage Permissions**) you want the role to be able to perform.
 
1. In the **Role Access** table, select the **Deny** option next to any action (**Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, **Manage Permissions**) you do not want the role to perform.

1. After assigning permissions to the role, click **Save**.
