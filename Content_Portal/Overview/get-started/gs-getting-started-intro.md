# Get started with OSIsoft Cloud Services 

This is an introduction to the main features of OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) using the OCS portal. Each section includes a tutorial with step-by- step procedures with links to basic concepts and best practices.

## Before you begin

Before you begin the getting started exercises, obtain the following:

- Request a tenant from your OSIsoft account manager. 
- You must have Tenant Administrator privileges. <!-- Verify that the change from Account Administrator to Tenant Administrator has occurred. -->

## Log into the OCS Portal

Once you have completed the pre-requisites, log into the OCS portal. 

1. In the web browser, enter the following URL: https://cloud.osisoft.com to open the OSIsoft Cloud Services web site. 

    Note: The latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox are supported.

3. In the toolbar, click **Sign In**.

4. In the Specify Account Id or Company Alias window, enter the account ID or the company alias for your account, and click **Continue**. <!--Check to see if this has been updated with "Tenant." -->"

   <!-- I'm guessing there are additional next steps that depend on the Identity Provider they are using? --> 

## Overview of the OCS Portal

<!-- Probably, we will need to modify this, make it shorter,  and point to the longer, yet to be written description. -->

The menu icon opens the menu from which you will navigate to the different OCS features. You always have access to this menu wherever you are in the OCS portal. 

When you click on one of the menu items, it takes you to the page for that resource. On most of the pages, there are two panes:

- The left pane is where you will be performing the tasks associated with the OCS resource. For example, the left pane is where you add and edit the OCS resource, and manage the permissions for the OCS resource.
- The right pane has one or more tabs.  
    - The Details tab contains additional information about your resource. 

    - The Information tab provides documentation on how to perform tasks on the page. 

      This Getting Started Guide provides additional information including explaining OCS concepts, best practices, and a walkthrough of how to set up and use these features.

    - Some resources have additional panes for additional configuration tasks.

## Getting started goals

In this Getting Started exercise, you will do the following:

1. Create a namespace that will contain all of your OCS resources, including an instance of the Sequential Data Store and the data streams.

2. Create a type that defines the data you want to store.

3. Create a stream container to store that data.
4. Create users, clients, and roles. 

Note: Each exercise is built upon the previous one; therefore, complete the exercises in the order shown. At the end of each exercise, you will be directed to the next one.
