# Share and unshare streams

Use these procedures to share or stop sharing streams of data with other communities. 

## Prerequisites to share streams

To share data streams with a community:

- There must already be data streams created within your tenant.

- Your user role must be assigned the **Share** permissions for data streams. For more information, see <xref:manage-streams>.

## Share streams

Users with the permissions to share streams within a community can share them using the Sequential Data Store. For instructions, see [Share stream](xref:manage-streams).

## Unshare streams from Community Details

To stop sharing streams, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community where you are sharing streams and select **Details**.

1. On the `Community Details` page, select the **Tenants** tab.

1. Select your own tenant.

   **Result:** A pane opens on the right.

1. On the **Streams** tab, select the streams you want to stop sharing, then select **Unshare Streams**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Unshare**.

**Result:** The streams are unshared from the community. Other tenants in the community can no longer view them.

## Unshare streams from the Sequential Data Store

Streams can also be unshared from the Sequential Data Store. For more information, see [Unshare streams](xref:manage-streams#unshare-streams).
