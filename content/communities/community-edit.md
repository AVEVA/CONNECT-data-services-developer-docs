# Edit community

After you create a community, you can edit its name and description at any time. You can also edit your contact email or add a community alias.

## Prerequisites

[!include[prereq-administrative-tenant](includes/prereq-administrative-tenant.md)]

## To edit a community

To edit a community:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. In **Edit Community**, edit the community **Name** and **Description**.

1. (Optional) Edit the community **Alias**.

	Use this field to provide an alias for the community. This alias replaces the community name in all places the name is referenced within OCS. The alias applies to your tenant only; other tenants in the community do not see it.

1. (Optional) Edit the community **Contact Email**.

	Use this field to provide a contact email address that your business partners can use to communicate with your organization for any questions or issues related to the community.

1. Select **Update**.
