# Share and unshare streams

Use these procedures to share or stop sharing streams of data with other communities.

**Note:** To share or unshare a stream, your role must have the Manage Permission privilege for that stream. By default any user who creates a stream has the Manage Permission privilege. To manage permissions for a role, use the **Sequential Data Store** > **Streams** feature.

## Share streams

To perform this procedure you must have already defined streams.

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

2. Optional: Click the **Change Namespace** button in the upper-right toolbar, then select the desired namespace.

3. If it is not already selected, select **Streams** at the top left.

4. Select one or more streams to share.

    To search for a particular stream, enter a search term in the **Search for streams** text box. If necessary, use a wildcard operator "*" to return results that start or end with a particular phrase. For more information, see [Search in SDS](xref:sdsSearching).

5. Click the **More Options** ![More Options](images\more-options.png "More Options") icon, then select **Share Stream** from the dropdown list.

    If you selected multiple streams in the previous step, a pane appears for managing streams. You can select **Share Streams** on that pane.

6. Click **Select Communities**.

    A list of communities appears.

7. Select the communities with which you want to share streams and click **Continue**. If necessary, you can filter the list of communities by typing in the **Filter Communities** box.

8. Click **Continue**. and then click **Share**. When prompted for confirmation, click **Confirm**.

    All members of the selected communities are able to read data from the shared streams.
