# Manage preferred region

Each community includes settings to manage the preferred region, which controls the geographical regions where operational data shared within a community is processed. By default, operational data is primarily processed in the `West-US` region for most requests, but data can be processed in other regions as well. Using the preferred region settings, you can override the default region to explicitly choose where operational data is processed.

## Why would I want to manage my preferred region?

For more information, see <xref:cross-region-data-sharing>.

## Prerequisites

- To manage the **Community Preferred Region** setting, you must be assigned a user role with [community administration permissions](xref:community-community-roles#community-administrators) on the [administrative tenant](xref:community-community-roles#administrative-tenant).

- To manage the **My Preferred Region** setting, you must be assigned a user role with [community administration permissions](xref:community-community-roles#community-administrators). Being a user of the administrative tenant is not required. 

## Manage preferred region settings

Edit the **Community preferred region** or **My preferred region** from a community's details.

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community you want to edit and select **Details**.

   - **Community Preferred Region**

	This setting is used to optimize access to community shared data. It ensures that queries are sent to the appropriate region if a tenant in the community opts-out of cross-region data sharing, which prohibits processing of data outside of the primary region where it resides. If no value is set, then **Community Preferred Region** setting defaults to the `West-US` region. Select the region where you expect most of the data in this community to reside. 

   - **My Preferred Region**

	This setting overrides the **Community Preferred Region** for your tenant and allows you to control which region your tenant's queries to this community are sent to.
