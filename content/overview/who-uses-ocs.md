# Who uses OSIsoft Cloud Services?  

OCS extends the data infrastructure seamlessly by integrating existing OSIsoft products and third-party vendors from edge to cloud. This allows data to be shared across the entire infrastructure, reaching new people such as developers creating custom applications, data scientists engaged in data modeling, operations staff who monitor real-time performance, and data analysts using visualized data. OCS enables this diverse group of people to access the data they need to perform their tasks. 

Accurate data is critical so that the insights it yields are a reliable source of truth for the entire enterprise. OCS extends the data infrastructure to your operational data. 

Extending the collection and accessibility of operational data allows new analysis and decision-making processes to benefit the company. Who uses this data and how does it help in their decision-making processes? 

## Data scientists use OCS to gain business insight 

Data scientists can easily integrate operational data from multiple sources for a variety of applications, such as process optimization and maintenance. Better data modeling enables smart decision-making based on clear answers about what is most relevant to a company’s goals. OCS uses the entire data infrastructure to gather the right type of data for modeling tools that answer business questions such as maintenance and demand forecasting. 

OCS improves business insight by: 

- Allowing the operations department and data scientists to share data and collaborate more effectively 
- Providing an environment in which data analysis artifacts are saved, enabling the data scientist to modify their models and workflow more efficiently 
- Ensuring that high-quality data is available for analysis 

### How does OCS enable data scientists?

#### Data is easier to consume

Curating and preparing data are the most time-consuming tasks when data scientists create their models. Bad data and data gaps decrease the integrity of results. In contrast, data that is contextualized, structured, filtered for relevancy, and presented in a format that is compatible for modeling tools and applications increases the efficiency of data scientists and the accuracy of their results. 

#### More data is available 

OCS removes the challenges of complicated and overbuilt data solutions, such as data lakes and relational databases, and provides a direct option for extending the data infrastructure. Because of the flexibility of the OCS REST API, OCS data can be consumed by many software applications that data scientists use to perform their analysis. 

#### Data is prepared for efficient consumption 

Use data views to organize and configure OCS data to be compatible with specific tools or applications. Add context to data through data views for easy identification and classification. Organize operational data in tabular form so it can easily be consumed by external tools via the REST API. Use data views to configure data sets for algorithms and modeling tools. 

#### Data modeling is flexible 

Data scientists need to experiment with and update their models. The REST API gives data scientists freedom to work with many different contemporary data modeling tools and applications. The REST API also provides flexibility as data science technology evolves. 

#### Data is contextualized

Data science models are only as good as the data used in those models. Identifying the data that is relevant is as important as the model used. OCS uses metadata rules to provide the context that makes it easy to search for data. OCS metadata rules parse and store data that match specific patterns. Additionally, OCS parses for user-provided context to identify patterns. When it finds a pattern, it attaches metadata.

#### APIs integrate operational data with applications

OCS supports easy integration with custom applications, extending the enterprise data infrastructure to in-house and partner applications. OCS offers ease of integration with a modern, secure REST API that is compatible with R and Python applications. Application developers use the REST API to interact with operational data on OCS. 

## Operations departments use OCS to monitor remote locations  

OCS provides the ability to integrate data infrastructure from edge to cloud seamlessly. Designed to serve as a "system of systems," OCS supports data usage across the global enterprise. 

In the past, data was often left stranded at remote locations due to the lack of reliable network connectivity. For instance, farms need data to answer questions such as how much grain is in a silo or what is the predicted corn harvest this season. Mining companies require data from mining trucks to know when maintenance is necessary. This untapped data can provide valuable insights for an enterprise and its decision making. 

Accessing and integrating these “dark” data locations is possible with edge systems and OCS. With pervasive data collectors, PI Adapters, Edge Data Store, and custom OMF applications, operational assets that were previously inaccessible are now viable data sources. 

The benefits of seamless integration of data infrastructure include: 

- Confidence that data across the entire spectrum is authoritative. 
- Data is compatible and native to the infrastructure across the spectrum. 
- Operational data can be accessed and used anywhere; it is no longer isolated in one facility or system. 
- New sources of operational data are available by storing the data in the cloud. 
- Existing edge and PI Server data is integrated into OCS.
