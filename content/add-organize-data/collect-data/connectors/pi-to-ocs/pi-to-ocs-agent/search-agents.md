# Search for an agent

You can search for PI to Data Hub Agents that have been installed on host machines at your organization to quickly locate agents of interest. For example, you may want to remove older agents. The global filter feature allows you to search by agent name, status, version number, hostname, PI Data Archive or AF server name, region, and namespace. 

To search for an agent in the portal:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Collection > PI to Data Hub Agents**.

1. In the **Filter Agents** field, enter the first few characters of the agent's name or version number.  

   Agents that meet the filter criteria are displayed in the list of agents.

1. (Optional) To clear the search, remove all characters from the **Filter Agents** field.
