1. In **Edit Community**, edit the community **Name** and **Description**. 

1. (Optional) Edit the community **Alias**.

	Use this field to provide an alias for the community. This alias appears instead of the community name for your tenant only.

1. (Optional) Edit the community **Contact Email**.

	Use this field to provide a contact email address that your business partners can use to communicate with your organization for any questions or issues related to the community.
