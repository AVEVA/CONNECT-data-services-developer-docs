Introducing the Sequential Data Store
=====================================

#### Introducing_SDS_topic


The Sequential Data Store (SDS) is a highly flexible cloud-based sequential data store that you use to store, 
retrieve, and analyze data. You 
create and write data to *streams* using a simple REST (*REpresentational State Transfer*) API (*Application 
Programming Interface*). The streams you create can be used to store simple or complex data types to suit 
your application needs. You can define simple or complex indexing to arrange and relate your data. An assortment 
of methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and easily obtain needed information.


Access to SDS
------------

You must acquire a Tenant, security credentials, and a Namespace before interacting with the Data Store. If you do not 
have a Tenant, you can request access to the SDS Preview at [OSIsoft Cloud Services](mailto://cloudservices@osisoft.com).

The SDS Preview program is limited; contacting OSIsoft does not assure participation.


If you are selected to
participate in the preview, you will receive an email notifying you of the name of your Tenant. 
Use the credentials you were provided to sign into the portal. Signing in grants you access 
to additional functionality.

Samples
------------

The best way to get started with SDS is to run one or more of the code samples. Code samples are 
provided in a number of different programming languages to illustrate how to easily and effectively 
interact with SDS. The code samples can be found in the SDS-Samples repository on GitHub. Obtain SDS 
REST API access keys from https://cloud.osisoft.com before running the sample code.

Each sample includes a readme file which describes the steps required to run the sample and a brief description 
that highlights some of the sampleâ€™s functionality. Be sure to read the readme file to understand 
how the sample works.

After you have finished this introduction and worked with one of the samples, refer to 
the [Quick_start_topic](xref:sdsQuickStart#quickstarttopic) section, which describes the interaction of 
various SDS objects and helps you get started with your own application.


Architecture
------------

A Tenant represents a client or organization that owns and manages a collection of OSIsoft Cloud Services, including 
the Sequential Data Store. 

Tenants are divided into one or more logical units called Namespaces. Each Namespace is distinct and separate from 
other Namespaces, with its own instances of the various OSIsoft Cloud Services and data stores. 
Namespaces provide isolation of resources. 

Isolation provided by Tenants and Namespaces prevent accidental or malicious data access.
