# Visualization

The Visualization menu provides tools to allow you to view data trends and use assets to set up digital twins of real-world physical entities:

* Use the `Trend` page to monitor assets, anticipate problems, and proactively perform preventative maintenance. On the `Trend` page, you can convert stream data to a graphic view, which can reveal patterns in data, data anomalies, or trouble spots. 

* Use the `Asset Explorer` page to create assets, then visualize data streams and properties to troubleshoot and analyze the associated devices.
