# Add and organize data

OCS provides a variety of methods to collect and organize data. You can transfer data to OCS from PI Server or from an external application. With the Sequential Data Store (SDS) you can store, retrieve, and organize any type of streaming data. You can attach meaning to data using these methods:

- Define assets that organize and visualize status and measurements of data.
- Create metadata rules that enable you to capture data streams based on specific data items, such as a plant location or device category.
- Use stream views to define a view of a subset of data from one or more streams. For example, you can use a stream view to make it appear as if you have changed the type on which a stream is based.
