# Step 3C: Manage permissions for namespaces

If you are assigned the **Manage Permissions** access right, then you can configure namespace permissions for other user roles in your tenant. You can granularly assign individual namespace permissions to each user role.

## Prerequisites

To manage namespace permissions, you must be assigned the **Manage Permissions** access right.

## To manage permissions for namespaces

Use the **Namespaces** dropdown list that is available on all pages to edit permissions for a namespace.

1. From the **Namespaces** dropdown list, select the namespace that you want to edit permissions for.

1. Select the **Manage Permissions** ![Manage Permissions](../../_icons/default/cog.svg) icon.

    The `Manage Permissions for Namespace` window opens.

1. Use the `Manage Permissions for Namespace` window to:

    - (Optional) Add user roles that have permissions on the namespace.
    - Edit namespace permissions for each user role.

    For more information, see [Manage Permissions window](xref:permissions-management#manage-permissions-window).

1. When you are finished editing permissions, select **Save**.
