# Add event

While viewing the data for a stream, you can add _events_, which are data points that the user manually adds to a stream. Any events that you add to a stream can then be visualized while viewing the stream's data or viewing the stream in a Trend session.

To add an event to a stream, complete the following steps.

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Select the stream to add an event for and choose **View Data**.

1. Select **Add Event**.

    The **Add Event** panel opens.

1. Select a key property for this stream event (for example, a timestamp).

1. Enter or select a value for each data type value.

    For enumerated data types, values map to the friendly name rather than an integer.

1. Select **Save**.

The event is added to the stream. You can view the new event in your list of data points creating a ranged query that includes your new event.

## Edit event

You can edit the values for any existing event.

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Select the stream to edit an event for and choose **View Data**.

1. Edit **Query Type** and its options to display the event that you want to edit.

1. Choose the event that you want to edit and select the **Edit** ![edit](../../../_icons/default/pencil.svg) icon.

1. Enter or select a value for each data type value.

    For enumerated data types, values map to the friendly name rather than an integer.

1. Select **Save**.

The stream event is edited.

## Remove event

You can remove any existing event.

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Select the stream to remove an event for and choose **View Data**.

1. Edit **Query Type** and its options to display the event that you want to remove.

1. Choose the event that you want to remove and select **More options** ![more options](../../../_icons/default/dots-vertical.svg) > **Remove Event**.

1. To confirm the removal, choose **Remove**.

The stream event is removed.
