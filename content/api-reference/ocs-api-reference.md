# OCS API reference

The information in the sections that follow document the APIs and usage for each of the following:

* [Asset store](xref:Assets)—Use the information in this section to create or find assets of different types, along with their data and status.

* [Client failover](xref:FailoverOverview)—The Client Failover Service provides failover capability for adapters to minimize data loss. 

* [Communities](xref:communityOverview)—OCS Communities help industrial companies share their operational data with external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers.

* [Data collection](xref:dataIngress)—You use Open Message Format (OMF) to achieve high-throughput asynchronous data ingress into the OCS Sequential Data Store.

* [Data views](xref:DataViewsOverview)—Use the information in this section to create user-selected subsets of data stored in OSIsoft Cloud Services which are mapped into customizable table formats.

* [Identity and access management](xref:identityandaccessmanagement)—Use the information in this section to create, manage and administer users and clients.

* [Operations](xref:operationsOverview)—Use the information in this section to get metrics on OCS operation.

* [Rules](xref:rules-lp)—The metadata rules feature in the OCS Portal simplifies the process of assigning metadata to streams.

* [Sequential Data Store (SDS)](xref:sds)—Use the information in this section to learn about the OSIsoft Cloud Services Sequential Data Store. The SDS is optimized for sequential data operations.

* [Tenant Management](xref:AccountManagementOverview)—Use the information in this section to create, manage, and administer your account by assigning users, roles, and namespaces to your tenant.

## Access to OCS

You must acquire an account before interacting with the OCS.
Go to the [OCS page on OSIsoft website](https://www.osisoft.com/pi-system/pi-cloud/osisoft-cloud-services), select [Contact Us](https://www.osisoft.com/contact) and request an OCS account.

## API console

For information on the graphical interface for using the REST API within OCS, see [API console](xref:apiConsole).

### Response format

Supported response formats include JSON, verbose JSON, and SDS.

In the API Console for AVEVA Data Hub Portal, the default value of the header `Accept-Verbosity` is `verbose` for the response format. Verbose JSON responses include all values in the returned JSON payload, including defaults. To specify verbose JSON return, add the header `Accept-Verbosity` with a value of `verbose` to the request.

Calls to the API from other sources do not include `Accept-Verbosity` as a standard. The `Accept-Verbosity` heading needs to be specified.  If you do not include the the `Accept-Verbosity` heading, all calls except for dataview calls will be `non-verbose` and dataview calls will be `verbose`.

When set to `non-verbose`, properties with null values are omitted from the response to reduce bandwidth. This behavior is only applicable to the JSON format, as all other formats represent a table which cannot have omitted values. Verbose has no impact on writes; writes return only error messages.

The default response format for SDS is JSON. Default JSON responses do not include any values that are equal to the default value for their type. Note that the `Accept-Verbosity` header for SDS differs as its default is set to `non-verbose`. Verbose has no impact on writes; writes return only error messages.

To specify SDS format, set the `Accept` header in the request to `application/sds`.

## Architecture

A tenant represents the set of services, applications, data, and configuration states available to a customer in OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS). Users are associated with a tenant via at least one configured identity provider, a database of user records that allows for authentication, and access to resources can be managed for those users via the assignment of roles.

Tenants are divided into one or more logical units called Namespaces. Each Namespace is distinct and separate from other Namespaces with its own instances of the various OSIsoft Cloud Services and data stores. Namespaces provide isolation of resources.

Namespaces are provisioned within a region. The Namespace's services and data stores all exist in the Namespace's region. Resources allocated to a Namespace are isolated to the Namespace's region. For more information on regions see the [Namespace](xref:AccountNamespace_1) documentation.  Isolation provided by Tenants and Namespaces prevents accidental or malicious data access.

OSIsoft Cloud Services provides data residency via namespaces in the following regions:

| Supported Regions | Geographic Area | Location |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| WestUS | Americas | California |
| WestEurope | Europe | Netherlands |

Tenant account information is stored in all regions for read-only purposes. Write operations are only supported through the global base URL. For information on how to access this data, see <xref:tenant-tenants>.

## OCS API versioning

New versions of the API are released when major changes occur in the OCS API. When a newer version of the API is released,
the legacy version of the API will only be supported for a period of time. We encourage all users to switch to the
newer version as soon as possible. Versions are inline in the routes, following the host:

```text
api/v{version}/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/...
```

Where:

* version is an incrementally (singular) increasing integer value
* v{version}-preview will be used to expose beta functionality

The currently supported versions are:

* v1
* v1-preview
