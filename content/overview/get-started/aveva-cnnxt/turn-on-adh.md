# Turn on AVEVA™ Data Hub for a folder

 Before AVEVA™ Data Hub can receive data for a given tenant, a folder must exist for that tenant. When you turn on the AVEVA™ Data Hub service and set up a folder in AVEVA™ Connect, a namespace is created with the same folder name. To change the name of a namespace, you must rename the folder in AVEVA™ Connext.

1. Navigate to the new folder and switch on the services your organization needs to use in the context of that folder.

2. Click the ellipse button on the bottom right of the Service tile and then click **Manage Roles** to ensure that the services turned on has the relevant permissions to be accessed by users.

    **Note:** If you do not set up folders, access to services can only be assigned at the account level. Some services can only be assigned at the folder level.
