# Part 2: Invite a tenant to a community

Before another tenant can join your community, you must send them an invitation, they must accept it, and then you must confirm it. In other words, you must complete a three-step handshake that requires collaboration with another tenant.

Complete the following procedures in order.

## Prerequisites

- You must be a [Community Owner](xref:ccRoles#community-owner-preview) or have [community administrator permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview).

- You must have the email address for the [Tenant Administrator](xref:ccRoles#tenant-roles) that you are inviting to the community.

## Step 1: Invite a tenant to the community

To invite another tenant to the community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community you want to invite another tenant to and select **Details**.

1. On the **Tenants** tab, select **Invite Tenant**.

1. Enter the email address of the Tenant Administrator. Then select **Invite**.

  An email is sent to the Tenant Administrator.

## Step 2: Wait for invited tenant to accept invitation

After you invite another tenant, wait for its Tenant Administrator to accept the email invitation. To monitor whether the invitation is accepted, select the **Invitations** tab and view the invitation recipient for a status of **Invitation Accepted**. You may need to refresh the page to see an updated status.

**Note:** If the invited tenant does not receive the initial email invitation, you can resend it to them. For instructions, see <xref:community-resend-invitation>. 

## Step 3: Confirm the invitation

To confirm an invitation, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. On the `Communities` overview page, find the community that you have invited another tenant to and select **Details**.

1. On the `Community Details` page, select the **Invitations** tab.

1. Select an invitation with a status of **Invitation Accepted**.

1. On the `Invitation Details` pane, select **Confirm Tenant**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Confirm Tenant** again.

  The invitee's tenant is now part of the community.
