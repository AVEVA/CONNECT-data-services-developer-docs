# Manage shared streams 

Users assigned share permissions for data streams in SDS explorer—also known as _data stewards_—can share those streams into communities where they are a member. These same users can unshare data streams from communities as well.

## Prerequisites

## Share streams

1. Select each stream that you want to share, and then select **More Options** ![More Options](../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Share Stream**.

    **Tips:** 

    * Use the **Search for streams** field to search for specific streams. Use the wildcard operator (`*`) to return results that start or end with a particular phrase. For more information, see [Search in SDS](xref:sdsSearching).

    * When sharing a large numbers of streams, edit the **Items per page** dropdown to a value that accommodates the number of streams that you want to share.

1. Select one or more community to share your streams with.

1. Select **Select Communities**.

1. From the list of communities, select the communities with which you want to share streams and select **Continue**. 

    **Tip:** Use the **Filter Communities** field to find a specific community.
    
1. To confirm that you want to share the streams with the chosen communities, select **Share**. From the **Share stream** window, select **Confirm**. Then select **Close**.

The chosen streams are shared with the chosen communities. All members of the selected communities are able to read data from the shared streams.

## Unshare streams

When you want to stop sharing streams with a community, you can unshare them from either the `Communities` page or `Sequential Data Store` explorer.

   A pane opens on the right.
