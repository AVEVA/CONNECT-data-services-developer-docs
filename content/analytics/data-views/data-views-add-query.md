# Step 2: Add a query

[!include[add-query](_includes/add-query.md)]

## To add a query

1. (Optional) From **Query Id**, overwrite the default value of `Query1` with a unique identifier.

1. From **Query Source**, select a namespace ![namespace](../../_icons/default/database.svg) or community ![community](../../_icons/default/share-variant.svg) to query operational data from. The source can either be a namespace from your own tenant or a community.

   You can filter the namespaces and communities that are listed using the slide toggles and the filter field.

   **Getting `This namespace does not allow data to be processed outside of the region where it resides` while adding a query?** See [Cross region processing disabled](#cross-region-processing-disabled).

1. From **Query Type**, select the type of object that you want to search for in the query source: **Streams** or **Assets**.

1. From **Query Value**, enter a query to find the objects that you want to include in the data view. Then select **Search**.

   For more information on how to enter a query, see <xref:search>.

   When the query populates with objects, you can view more about each object by selecting it from the table. The object details display in the pane on the right.

1. (Optional) To add additional queries to the data view, select **Add Query** and repeat the steps listed above.

1. Once you are satisfied with your queries and query results, select **Save**.

## Cross region processing disabled

When adding a query to a data view, you may encounter unavailable sources within the **Query Source** list that display the following tooltip when moused over: `This namespace does not allow data to be processed outside of the region where it resides`. This message indicates that the source tenant has opted out of sharing namespace data across regions for performance purposes, and therefore, the data view cannot be processed in your geographical region. For additional information, see <xref:cross-region-data-sharing>.
