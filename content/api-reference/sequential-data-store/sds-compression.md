# Compression
To use network bandwidth efficiently, the OCS Sequential Data Store supports compression for [reading](xref:sdsReadingDataApi) and
[writing data](xref:sdsWritingDataApi) through the REST API.

## Supported compression schemes
- ``gzip``
- ``deflate``

## Request compression for writing data
The body content of an HTTP request can be compressed using the [supported compression schemes](#supported-compression-schemes) allowing you to send stream values to the REST API more efficiently.

The ``Content-Encoding`` HTTP header must be used to specify the compression scheme of compressed-content requests. This header provides context to the API to properly decode the request content.

## Response compression for reading data
Compressed responses can be requested from the REST API by specifying one of the [supported compression schemes](#supported-compression-schemes) using the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header.

Compressed responses from the REST API will include a ``Content-Encoding`` HTTP header indicating the compression scheme used to compress the response content.

> [!Note]
> Specifying a compression scheme through the use of the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header does not guarantee a compressed response. Always refer to the presence and value of the ``Content-Encoding`` HTTP header of the response to properly decode the response content.
