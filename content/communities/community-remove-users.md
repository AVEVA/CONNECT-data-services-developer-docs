# Remove users from a community

When you remove users from a community, they can no longer view the community, view the data shared within it, nor share data with the community.

## Prerequisites

To remove users from the community, you must be assigned [community administrator permissions](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview).

## To remove users from a community

To remove tenant users from a community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community where you want to remove users and select **Details**.

1. On the **My Members** tab, select one or more users. A details pane appears. If necessary, filter the list of users by typing in the **Filter users** box.

1. On the detail pane, select **Remove User(s)**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Remove**.
