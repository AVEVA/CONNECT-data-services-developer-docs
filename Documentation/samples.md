Samples
=======

The Qi-Samples illustrate several ways for applications to interact with the Qi REST API.

The examples cover the basics of interacting with Qi, such as:

* Connecting to Qi 
* Creating QiTypes and instances of QiStreams 
* Sending data to, and retrieving data from QiStreams 
* Performing queries against QiStreams 
* Removing QiStreams and QiTypes

Currently, the samples are available in these languages:

* C# 
* Java
* Python

Because the examples are intended for demonstration purposes, they represent some example
practices. The patterns may change as the Qi Preview progresses. Be sure
to follow the Qi-Samples repository on GitHub for updates.
