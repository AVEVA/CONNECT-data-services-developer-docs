# Deploy an edge system configuration

After you export an edge system configuration, you have to manually deploy the configuration to the edge system in the field.

For details, refer to the specific edge system product documentation: 

 - [Edge Data Store](xref:https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/edge-data-store/page/configuration/configuration.html)

 - [OPC UA adapter](xref:https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/pi-adapter-opc-ua/page/configuration/configuration.html)

 - [Modbus TCP adapter](xref:https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/pi-adapter-modbus/page/configuration/configuration.html)

If you modify the configuration during deployment, import the updated configuration to the corresponding edge system in OCS to have an accurate record of the configuration.
