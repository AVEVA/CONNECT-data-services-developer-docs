# Get started with PI to OCS connections

Before you set up your PI to OCS connection, see [PI System best practices](xref:bpPISystemConnection) for recommendations on the PI OCS Agent.

To use PI to OCS to transfer data from a PI System to OCS, you must complete the following tasks:

- Install the PI to OCS Agent.

- Set up your PI to OCS connection in the PI to OCS Configuration Utility.

- Create a data transfer.

**Prerequisite:** The exercise below assumes that your organization has a PI System with default PI points (for example, `sinusoid`) stored on Data Archive.

To set up a PI to OCS transfer:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Collection** > **PI to OCS Agents**.

1. Select **Download Agent**, then follow the instructions in the [Install the PI to OCS Agent](xref:install-agent) topic.

1. After agent installation, follow the instructions in the [Run the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility](xref:pi-to-ocs-utility) topic to set up the PI to OCS connection and register your agent on OCS.

1. After successful data source configuration, return to the `PI to OCS Agents` window in the OCS portal.

1. Select your PI to OCS Agent connection in the `PI to OCS Agents` window, then select **Create Transfer** in the right pane.

1. Follow the steps in the [Transfer data to OCS](xref:transfer-data) topic to define transfer settings and transfer data into OCS.

## Next step

If you have not already completed [Get started with OMF connections](xref:gsOMF), do this next. Otherwise, continue with [Get started with types](xref:gsTypes).
