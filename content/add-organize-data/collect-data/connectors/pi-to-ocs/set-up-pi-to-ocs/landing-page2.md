## Set up PI to OCS
<br>

This section contains the following topics:

* [Disable Internet Explorer enhanced security](xref:disable-ie-security)
* [Install the PI to OCS Agent](xref:install-agent)
* [Run the PI to OCS Agent Configuration Utility](xref:pi-to-ocs-utility)


**IMPORTANT:** The PI to OCS Agent requires the Windows service to "run as user". You must have read access to PI Data Archive security tables and PI point data. See [PI to OCS minimum system requirements](xref:min-sys-reqmnts) for more information.
