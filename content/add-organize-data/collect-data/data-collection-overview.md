# Collect data

Collect data from an external application or from PI Server directly to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub using the following methods:

* Use PI to Data Hub to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub. 
  
  * PI to Data Hub maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.
  
  * PI to Data Hub transfers AF elements and attributes as AVEVA&trade; Data Hub assets and metadata and properties.  

* Use Open Message Format (OMF) to pass JSON messages to AVEVA&trade; Data Hub using an HTTP client. 

  * OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into AVEVA&trade; Data Hub. 

* Use Edge Systems to monitor the health and manage the configuration of edge systems on remote devices.
