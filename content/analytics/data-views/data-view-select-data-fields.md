# Step 3.1: Select data fields

In the `Add Data Fields` window, select the data fields that you want to include in the data field set for each query. You can filter the data fields listed for each query by [summary type](#filter-by-summary-type) or by [text](#filter-by-text).

**Tip:** To display which fields are already included in the data view, select **Show Included Fields**.

After you choose data fields, perform one of the following actions:

- Select **Apply** to finish adding data fields to your data view. You can always edit the data fields later.

- Select **Next** to edit the selected data fields. For more information, see [2. Edit data fields (optional)](#2-edit-data-fields-optional).

## Filter by summary type

You can filter the data fields listed for each query by summary type, which returns different calculations for a given data field. The `Value` summary type is selected by default.

## Filter by text

You can further filter the data fields listed for each query by text.
