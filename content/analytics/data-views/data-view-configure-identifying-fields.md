# Step 3.4: Edit identifying fields

If the field set resolves to multiple data items in any group (or if grouping is not used), then you should designate an **Identifying field** for the field set. The identifying field of a data field set specifies the primary field to identify multiple items in a group. This identification methods allows the identifying field value to be used automatically in field labels of the group. If a lone criterion is not a sufficient or useful way of disambiguating the fields, then grouping by additional criteria may be necessary. 

To add an identifying field to the field set for a query, select an eligible field from the **Identifying field** dropdown.
