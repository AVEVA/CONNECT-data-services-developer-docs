# Step 3B: Map a group to an AVEVA Data Hub role

Assign an existing AVEVA Connect group to a Data Hub role to control what actions users assigned to this group can take in AVEVA Data Hub. 

To assign an existing AVEVA Connect group to a Data Hub role:

1. Open the AVEVA Data Hub portal.

1. From the left pane, select **Security** > **Groups**.

1. Select **Add Group**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the name or first few characters of the AVEVA Connect group name, then press Enter.

  The group appears in the **Name** field.

1. Assign a role, or multiple roles, to the group to control the actions members can take in the AVEVA Data Hub portal, then select **Save**.
