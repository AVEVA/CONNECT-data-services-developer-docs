# Step 2: Add a query

1. In the center pane, update the **Query Id** field to a new value or accept the default of *Query1*.

1. For **Query Type**, select **Streams** or **Assets** to indicate which objects to search for this query.

   **Note**: Assets are available for use through specific licensing only. If you are interested in using Assets, contact your account team for more details.

1. For the **Query Value** search field, enter a portion of the name of any known stream or asset preceded or followed by the wildcard operator (_*_), and then select **Search** to search for available streams or assets.

1. Select any stream or asset in the query results to display and view the individual data fields to the pane on the right.

   **Note**: If you have created a metadata rule in the same namespace, you can enter a selected metadata key instead of a stream or asset name in the **Search** field to display a more specific set of streams or assets.

1. (Optional) To add additional queries, select **Add Query**, enter the appropriate query value in the **Query Value** search field, and then select **Apply**.

1. Select **Save** to accept the query results as the basis of the data view.
