# Manage streams

The Sequential Data Store gives you capabilities to manage stored streams. The capabilities function the same if you are working in the context of a namespace or a community.

## Manage permissions

For a role to perform any actions on a stream, you must grant that role permissions for the stream. For any stream, you can assign the following permissions to a role:

- Read
- Write
- Delete
- Manage Permissions
- Share

1. From the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Select one or more streams.

1. Select **More options** ![More options icon](../../../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Manage Permissions**.

1. In the `Manage Permissions` window, from **Select Role**, choose the role whose permissions you want to modify.

1. Select the permissions to grant to the selected role, and then select **Save**.

## Add tags or metadata

Tags and metadata allow you to associate additional information with a stream. For example, tags can denote special attributes for a stream. Metadata consists of keys and their associated values.

1. From the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Select a stream.

1. Select **More options** ![More options icon](../../../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Edit Stream**.

   A tab opens to allow you to modify the metadata and tags for the stream.

1. Add metadata.

   - Select the **Metadata** tab, and then select **Add Metadata**. In the `Metadata Key` box, enter the name of the key and in the `Metadata Value` box, enter a value for that key.

   - To remove a metadata, select the **X** beside the row to be deleted.

1. Add tags.

   - Select the **Tags** tab, if it is not already selected. In the `New Tag` box, enter the name of the tag, and then select the plus sign (**+**).
   
   - To remove a tag, select the **X** beside the tag name.

## Share streams

Users with permissions to share a data stream within a [community](xref:communities) can do so from the Sequential Data Store. For more information on completing this process, see [Share streams](xref:community-manage-shared-streams#share-streams)

## Unshare streams

Users with permissions to share a data stream within a community can also unshare it, removing the stream data from the community. For more information on completing this process, see [Unshare streams](xref:community-manage-shared-streams#unshare-streams).

## Remove streams

When you remove a stream, you are deleting it.

1. From the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Sequential Data Store**.

1. Select one or more streams.

1. Select **More options** ![More options icon](../../../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Remove Stream**.

1. In the confirmation window, select **Remove** to confirm the deletion.
