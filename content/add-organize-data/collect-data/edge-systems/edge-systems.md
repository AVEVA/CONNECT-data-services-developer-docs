# Edge systems

Edge systems provides a centralized location to monitor the health and manage the configuration of edge systems on remote devices, including Edge Data Store and PI Adapters, giving you visibility into the data collection solution. See the current status of each system and when it last communicated with OCS. Use sort and filter functionality to pinpoint problems and identify gaps in data collection. Review detailed information about each edge system device, its components, and its configurations.

Create, edit, and manage edge system configuration and manually apply new or updated configurations to edge systems. You can manually reconcile configuration changes made in the field with configurations created in the OCS portal.

View detailed health information for your edge systems to understand the overall health of these edge systems. Additionally, PI Interfaces that are configured to send health messages directly to OCS are included in the health information.
