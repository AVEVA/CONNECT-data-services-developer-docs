# Manage default community administrators

Permissions for administration of a community are assigned to users through roles. By default, when you set up a community, administration permissions are assigned to three roles: Community Administrator, Super Admin, and Tenant Administrator. However, you can manage which roles in your tenant are assigned administration permissions by default.

## To manage default community administrators

To manage default community administrators, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Select **More Options** ![More Options](../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Manage Default Community Administrators**.

1. Add or remove roles as default community administrators. 

	To add a role, select **Add Roles** and then select **Add Role** ![add role](../_icons/plus-thick-alt.svg) for any role that you want to function as community administrator. 

	To remove a role, select **Remove Role** ![Remove Role](../_icons/remove-object.svg).

1. Select **Save**.

The default community administrator roles are updated. The next time that you create a community, the default community administrator roles will be updated according to your settings.
