# Enable stream sharing permissions

Before your tenant users can share data within a community, you must first manage stream permissions for your tenant. To allow stream sharing, you must allow the **Share** access type for one or more user role.  You can enable stream sharing permissions on a per-stream basis. Users assigned this role will then have permission to share specific streams within a community. For instructions on how to allow sharing for a stream, see [Manage streams: Manage permissions](xref:xref:manage-streams#manage-permissions).
