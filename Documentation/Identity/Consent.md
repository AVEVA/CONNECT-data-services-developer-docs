You have chosen to use your organization’s existing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to log in to OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS). In order to proceed, you will need to complete the consent workflow. In this step, you will grant permissions for OSIsoft Cloud Services Identity to do the following:

- Sign in and read user profile (delegated permission)

Below are the next steps required to complete your OCS account provisioning:

- Click on the link provided in the email. Note that you will need to log in as a user with the Global Administrator role on your Azure AD.
- Upon login, you’ll be prompted to grant consent for one application: OSIsoft Cloud Services Identity.
- Select the box "Consent on behalf of the organization" before clicking the consent button.

OCS will notify the initial signup user via email once the account is ready.
