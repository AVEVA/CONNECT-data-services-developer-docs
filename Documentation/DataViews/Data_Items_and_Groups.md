# Data Items and Groups

A `DataItem` is an SdsStream included in the data view. The collection of data items is specified by the data view queries, where the queries define the search criteria and the data items represent the results of the search. The data view can include one or more properties from each data item.


## Data Items

The collection of data items in the data view represents all SdsStreams that match the [`.queries`](xref:DataViewsQueries) field of the data view, excluding ones that are "ineligible" (see discussion of ineligible data items below). To add data items to a data view, either refine an existing query, or add a new query (refer to [queries](xref:DataViewsQueries) for which option to choose from). Similarly, to remove data items from a data view, either refine an existing query, or remove a query (this will remove all data items from the query). 

Note that each query is executed independently to generate the list of data items. It is thus possible to have duplicate data items resulting from different queries. This can be desirable and undesirable depending the use case.

### Adding Fields
Each data item contains information that can be optionally (and explicitly) added to the data view by setting the [`.data field sets`](xref:DataViewsFieldSets) field of the data view. Currently, the only supported resource type is `stream` with the following available fields:
* Stream id
* Stream name
* Stream tags
* Stream metadata
* Data from each stream property


### Adding or Removing SdsStreams
When requesting for [resolved data items](xref:ResolvedDataViewAPI) or when [getting the data view data](xref:DataViewsDataAPI), the list of data items reflect the list of SdsStreams that match one or more queries when the data view was last resolved. This means that if new streams were added or existing streams were removed from the Sequential Data Store, the list of data items will only reflect the latest changes if the data view is re-resolved. For more information, refer to the caching section in the resolved data view resource [page](xref:ResolvedDataView).


## Ineligible Data Items

The collection of ineligible data items represents SdsStreams that match the queries but cannot be included in the data view. The criteria for ineligibility are:
* When the SdsStream's index type is different than the `IndexTypeCode` specified in the data view.
* When the SdsType of the stream contains compound indexes. 


## Groups

[Grouping](xref:DataViewsGrouping) is optional when defining the data view. If the `.GroupingFields` section is not defined on the data view, the resolved data view shows a single group with all eligible data items. If the `.GroupingFields` is defined, the resolved data view shows multiple groups, each with the list of data items for the group and the `.values` field showing the matching group's value(s). In this case, if a data item does not match any group, it is added to all groups.
