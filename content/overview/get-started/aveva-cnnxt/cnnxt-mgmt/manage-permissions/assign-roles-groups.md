# Assign roles to groups

When a role is assigned to a group, all the users in that group will see the Data Hub tile on their home page in AVEVAâ„¢ Connect. You must assign a user or group to one or more roles based on the actions they need to take in Data Hub. 

Perform the following steps to assign roles to a group:

1.	From the Connect home page, click the menu icon, then select **User Management**.

2.	Click the **Groups** tab. 

    **Result:** The existing groups are listed.

3.	Select the required group to which you want to assign roles.

4.	Click the **Roles** tab. The list of existing roles assigned to the group is displayed.

    **Note:** You can search for the required group by typing a few letters in the Filter by group name field.

5.	Click **+ Assign role** to assign more roles to the group. The Assign role area is displayed.
 
6.	Select the type of role:

    - Select Service role if you want to assign a functional role to the group
    - Select Account role if you want to assign an administrative role (giving users and/or groups access to administer your AVEVA Connect account) 

7.	If you have selected **Service role**, select the required service and folder from the **Service** and **Folder** lists.

8.	Select the required role from the **Role** list.

9.	Select the required groups to assign this role. You can select multiple groups at once. You can search for the group names by typing a few letters in the **Enter group name(s)** field.
