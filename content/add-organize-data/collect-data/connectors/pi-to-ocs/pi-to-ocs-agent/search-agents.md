# Search for an agent

You can search for PI to OCS Agents that have been installed on host machines at your organization to quickly locate agents of interest. For example, you may want to remove older agents. The global filter feature allows you to search by agent name, status, version number, hostname, PI Data Archive or AF server name, region, and namespace.  

1. In the left pane, click **Data Collection > PI to OCS Agents**.

   **Result:** The **PI to OCS Agents** window opens.

1. In the **Filter Agents** text box, enter the first few characters of the agent's name or version number.  

   **Result:** If there is a match, any agents that meet the filter criteria are displayed in the list of agents.
