# Share a view of your fleet

You may have many hundreds or even thousands of assets in your fleet. Working with colleagues on different computers and in different locations, you need to look at the same set of assets. The asset explorer allows you to filter and view a subset of the assets and share this view with others. 

To filter and view a subset of assets, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Visualization** > **Asset Explorer**.

1. Verify that the **Assets/Asset Type** selector is set to **Assets**.

1. Enter a string in the **Search for Assets** field to search the assets that are displayed.

1. Select the **Shared Filtered Assets** icon ![Share](../_icons/default/share.svg) in the toolbar to copy the URL to the clipboard. 

   **Note:** Send this link to your colleagues and partners. When they paste this URL into a browser, they will see the fleet view you created.

   **Tip:** Bookmark this link to return to this fleet view.
