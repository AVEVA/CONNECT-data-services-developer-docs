# Add community administrators

Although you initially configure which tenant roles can administer a community during community creation, you can edit which roles can administer the community at any time.

## Prerequisites 

To add community administrators, you must be a [community administrator](xref:ccRoles#community-administrators-preview) yourself.

## Add community administrators

To add community administrator permissions to a user role, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. Find the community you want to leave and select **Details**.

1. Select **More Options** ![More Options](../_icons/dots-vertical.svg) > **Manage Community Administrators**.

    Select **Add Roles** and then select **Add Role** ![add role](../_icons/plus-thick-alt.svg) for any role that you want to function as community administrator. 

1. Select **Save**.
