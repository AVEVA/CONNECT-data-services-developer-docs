# Streams best practices

The following best practices are recommended when creating streams:

- Ensure that the default stream permissions are configured before you begin creating streams. While you can later do a bulk update of stream permissions, it is easier to configure the default permissions before the streams are created. Permissions that vary from the default are configured on the individual streams.

- Use a meaningful pattern when naming streams. For example, a naming pattern might be "*Company_name*.{*Region*}.{*Site*}.{*Equipment*}". This makes it possible for tools, such as metadata rules, to use this naming schema to find relevant data. Metadata like this can also be stored as key-value pairs on the stream, but a well-defined naming pattern allows metadata to be generated automatically. 

- Use the stream description field, metadata, and tags to capture any other relevant information about the stream. This information is useful to search for specific streams in the system, especially as systems become large. If possible, use consistent patterns in description, metadata, and tags.
   - Use metadata for information that follows a specific or consistent pattern, such as the location, manufacturer, and site. 
   - Use tags for simple information about the stream that does not adhere to any particular pattern.
   - Use the description field for longer descriptions of the stream and what it represents.
