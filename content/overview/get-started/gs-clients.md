# Get started with clients

Clients provide a way for users or applications to authenticate against AVEVA&trade; Data Hub from applications other than the portal. AVEVA&trade; Data Hub supports different client types, each of which support different types of applications. For more information on client types, see the following topics:
 
- [Client-credentials clients](xref:gsClientCredentialsClients)

- [Authorization code clients](xref:gsAuthorizationCodeClients)

- [Hybrid clients](xref:gsHybridClients)

You can start with any of the clients and progress to the other two.
