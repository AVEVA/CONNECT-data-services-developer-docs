# Tenant management

The Tenant Management API allows you to create, manage, and administer Aveva&trade; Data Hub tenants by assigning users, roles, and namespaces to tenants. Through the API, you can manage access control to the Aveva&trade; Data Hub infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the tenant management features. Administration functionality is also available from the Aveva&trade; Data Hub portal.
