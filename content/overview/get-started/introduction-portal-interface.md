# Introduction to the portal interface

This topic provides a brief overview of the elements you interact with on the OCS portal interface.

When you first access the interface, you see several panes providing information about the state of your system's health as well as quick links to popular documentation topics.

- **Visualization**: Allows you to view data trends and use assets to set up digital twins of real-world physical entities.
- **Analytics**: Provides tools for shaping and querying large datasets.
- **Security**: Allows you to specify identity providers for authentication and add users, roles, and clients to your tenant.
- **Developer Tools**: Provides code samples, an API console, and an editor for the OSIsoft Message Format (OMF).

Most pages consist of two panes:

- The left pane is where you perform the tasks associated with the OCS resource. For example, the left pane is where you add and edit or manage permissions for the OCS resource.
- The right pane has one or more tabs:   
  - The Details tab contains additional information about the selected resource.
  -  The Information tab provides documentation about the current feature and describes how to perform relevant tasks.
  - Some resources have additional panes for other configuration tasks.
