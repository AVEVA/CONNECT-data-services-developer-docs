# Manage tenants in a community

Use the `Community Details` page to manage tenants that already belong to a community. This page also lets you add tenants to a community.

To create a new community, see [Add a community](xref:add-community).
## Remove a tenant from a community

Use this procedure to remove a tenant from a community. This action might be necessary if a business relationship changes or if the tenant's organization experiences a security breach.

After removing a tenant, you can re-invite the tenant to the community but all data that was previously shared must be shared again with the returning tenant.

**Note:** Only a user who has a [Community Administrator](xref:communityroles#community-administrator) role can remove a tenant from a community.  

To remove a tenant from a community, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Data Management** > **Communities**.

1. On the `Tenant Details` pane, select **Remove Tenant**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Remove Tenant** again.
