# Create a data view

Data views are subsets of data from one or more streams. You create a data view by defining the target namespace, and then specifying the source stream or streams, selected data fields, time period, and interpolation interval. 

## Procedure

1. In the left pane, select **Analytics** > **Data Views**.
2. In the `Data Views` pane of the OCS Portal, click **Add Data View**.
3. Enter the data view name and description in the `Data View Information` pane.
4. Click **Standard** or **Narrow** to specify the general shape of the data display.
5. In the `Query ID` field in the center pane, enter a name for *Query1* in the **Query ID** field, or accept the default name. 
6. In the `Query Type` section, select **Streams** or **Assets** to indicate which objects you want this query to search.

   **Note**: Assets are available for use through specific licensing only. If you are interested in using Assets, contact your account team for more details. 
   
6. In the `Search` field of the `Query Value` section, type a portion of the name of any known stream or asset (preceded/followed by the * wildcard symbol). 

   **Note**: If you have created a metadata rule in the same namespace, you can enter a selected metadata key instead of a stream name in the `Search` field to select a more specific set of streams.
   
7. Click **Save**. The query results populate and the `Index Configuration` pane displays.
8. In the `Index Configuration` pane, select the date and time for the **Start Index** and **End Index** to specify the time period of the data to include in the data view.
9. In the `Time Interval` field, specify the time interval by which to display data. The `Time Interval` field provides entry spaces for Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
10. Select **Save Default with Data View** to save your settings with this data view.
11. In the `Field Management` pane, click **Add**. Then in the `Add Data Fields` window, select the data fields from the query results to include in the data view and click **Add**.
12. In the `Field Management` pane, use the **Up** and **Down** Arrow buttons to move selected data fields up or down in the display, and click **Apply**.
13. Click **Save**.
