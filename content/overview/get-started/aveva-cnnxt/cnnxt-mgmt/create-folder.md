# Create a folders

If you need to restrict the context in which your users and/or groups are assigned access to a service, you must set up folders. 

A folder is used to partition data and you can use child folders to partition the data even further. For example, you can create folders to divide up assets in your organization. <!--Do these partitions usually exist for a customer to represent different regions or something else?-->

**Important:** When you turn on the AVEVA™ Data Hub service and set up a folder in AVEVA™ Connect, a namespace is also created using the name of the Connect folder. See Namespaces in AVEVA™ Data Hub for more information.

Perform the following steps to create folders in AVEVA™ Connect.

1. In the navigation menu, select **Folder Management**, then click the **Add Folder** button.

   **Result:** The Add Folder area is displayed.

2.	Enter the name of the new folder in the **Folder name** field

   **Note:** The new folder will be created in the selected region only and the region cannot be changed after the folder is created. You can click **Change** and select a different region.

Select **Upload image** to use your own image or **Select stock image** to use an existing image for the new folder.
    
   **Note:** The image is used in the carousel of folders displayed on the AVEVA™ Connect home page users see.
