# PI to OCS architecture



How does PI to OCS connects to my Data Archive and AF servers so I can deploy the PI to OCS agents in a way that I can transfer all of the data I need to?

Document supported architecture for PI to OCS and how it can connect to a single Data Archive and single AF Server.

Document any restrictions such as, if you establish a connection to a given AF server, the only Data Archive server you can connect to with the same PI to OCS agent must be referenced in that AF server.
