# What is a PI point type change?

A PI point type change occurs when a PI point's type is changed on the source PI Data Archive after the corresponding stream has been created in the AVEVA Data Hub Sequential Data Store (SDS) database. When the PI to Data Hub Agent detects this change, it takes the following actions:

- Displays the `PI Point Type Change Detected` message next to the **Current Activity** field in the Details pane as shown in the screenshot below.
 
- Prevents data being sent from the source PI point to the SDS stream until the type is changed to match the corresponding SDS Stream type and the transfer is restarted.
 
- Logs details about the corresponding SDS stream in both the Windows Event Viewer and AVEVA Data Hub logs.

A point change can occur for the following reasons:

* The source PI point had an incorrect configuration of data and type. The data and point must be deleted and recreated.

* The source PI point was misconfigured initially. For example, the point needed to be updated from `Float32` to `Float64`. The data is still relevant and should be kept.

* Other reasons
<!--Angela Flores 6/28/21 This list is oddly specific. Also, what is PI to Data Hub Services? And PI to Data Hub service? This topic still needs work. --> 
<!--VT, 11/29/21: PI to Data Hub Services/service is the PI to Data Hub Agent. I had a discussion w/one of the Bonsai developers, Zane Odeh & he confirmed this info. They have been removed from this topic. This topic was updated recently. What other work is needed?-->

After you create an SDS stream, its underlying SdsType cannot change. As a result, new data from the PI point in question cannot be stored in the same stream. You can resume streaming data from the PI point to the existing SDS stream by taking the following corrective actions:

- View the [Windows Event Viewer logs](xref:view-logs) or [AVEVA Data Hub logs](xref:download-tenant-log) to determine which PI point incurred a PI point type change.

    **Note:** The Windows Event Viewer logs is the preferred source of information for PI point type changes.

- Change the PI point type to match the SDS stream type and then restart the transfer.

To see what types of point coercions are supported in PI Data Archive, refer to the ["Allowable point type coercions"](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/pi-server/page/allowable-point-type-coercions.html) topic.<!--Angela Flores 6/28/21 should that be "coercions" or "conversions"? --> <!--VTT, 11/29/21: Coercion is the preferred term per the referenced topic.-->
