# Data sharing

After a community administrator adds you as a member of the community, you can share data streams from your tenant with the rest of the community or view data that other tenants and community members have shared.

- <xref:ShareStreams>

	Share a data stream with the community or unshare one.

- <xref:view-community-data>

	View which streams are shared within a community, or view the stream data that another tenant has shared.
