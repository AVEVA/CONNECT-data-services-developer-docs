# User Roles

User `Roles` authorize API requests made by users to various OCS features. Users can be assigned more than one `Role`,
but all users have the Account Member role. The following are currently available User `Roles`:
- Account Administrator: Can add, edit, and remove users. Can also edit the permissions of existing users.
- Account Member: Can log in and access the OCS portal.


## Properties

| Property Name | Data Type | Description | 
 | --- | --- | ---  | 
| UserId | string | String value that identifies the user. |
