# Data collection

The Data Collection menu provides a number of methods for collecting data from external sources to bring into OCS:

* Use `Software Management` to monitor the health and manage the software configuration on edge systems.

* Use `PI to OCS Agents` to set up a transfer of data from an on-premises PI Server to OCS. PI to OCS maps PI Data Archive points to SDS types and streams.

* Use `OMF Connections` to pass JSON messages to OCS using an HTTP client. OMF is a platform-independent format that can provide a high-throughput data feed into OCS.
