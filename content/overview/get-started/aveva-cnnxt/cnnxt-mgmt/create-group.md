# Create a group

To be assigned access to a service, users must belong to one or more groups (unless you have assigned individual roles to your user). 

**Note:** All users created in your account belong to the default 'User' group in AVEVA Connect.

Perform the following steps to create a group and add users to the group:

1.	Click the menu icon, then select **User Management**.

2.	Click the **Groups** tab. 

    **Result:** The existing groups are listed.

3.	Click **+ Add group**. 
 
    **Result:** The **Add group** area is displayed.

4.	Enter the required group name in the **Group name** field.

5.	Enter a description for the group in the **Group description** field.

6.	Optional: Select the required users to add to this group. 

7. Click **Save**.
 
   **Result:** The group is created, and the specified users are added to the group.

   **Note:** You can modify exisiting groups from the Groups tab. After you select an exisiting group from the list, you can add or remove exisiting users from that group and assign or revoke roles to the existing users in that group.
