# Launch a service from AVEVA™ Connect

Your AVEVA™ Connect home page lists all the services you have access to as a set of tiles. Click anywhere on the appropriate tile to launch the service you wish to use.

All AVEVA™ Connect services are listed in the Service Catalog. You can view the catalog to discover AVEVA™ services. <!--If a service appears in the Service Catalog, does it mean that the user/organization has access to it?-->
