# Tenant management

The Tenant Management API allows you to manage and administer AVEVA Data Hub tenants by assigning users and roles to tenants. Through the API, you can manage access control to the AVEVA Data Hub infrastructure. Generally, only administrators should have access to the tenant management features. Administration functionality is also available from the AVEVA Data Hub portal.
