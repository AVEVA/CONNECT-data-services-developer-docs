# Community administration

After a community is established, the community administrator from each tenant can perform administrative actions as needed. Each community administrator can only perform administrative actions within their own tenant. They cannot manage other tenants within the community.

Administrative actions include managing tenant members, managing client applications that can access the OSIsoft Cloud Services API programmitically, withdrawing from the community, or deleting the community itself.
