# Community setup

Establish a community by creating it and then inviting your trusted business partners to join from their tenant. Each invitation is a three-way handshake where one tenant sends an invitation, the invited tenant accepts, and then the original tenant confirms that the expected tenant accepted.

Setup of a community involves coordination between multiple tenants and users with different permissions. Before you start setup of a community, review the figure below to better understand the entire community setup process.

**Note:** This figure offers a high-level view of the entire community setup process. For more information on low-level details on completing the setup process, see the topics that follow this one.
