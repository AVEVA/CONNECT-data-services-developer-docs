# Add and edit base configurations

You can create and edit base configurations for edge systems in AVEVA Data Hub. Once the configuration is complete, you can export the configuration file by each component or edge system to manually apply to the edge system in the field. You can also use an exported configuration file as a template for configuring other edge systems by importing it during configuration. Default configurations are available for supported edge system types. The maximum size for a configuration file is 16 MB.

**Note:** You can create configuration templates for the following edge system types:

 - Edge Data Store

 - PI Adapter for BACnet
 
 - PI Adapter for DNP3
 
 - PI Adapter for Modbus TCP
 
 - PI Adapter for OPC UA
