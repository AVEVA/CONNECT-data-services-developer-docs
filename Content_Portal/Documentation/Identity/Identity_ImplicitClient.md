# Implicit Client (deprecated)

Implicit Client has been deprecated. We suggest using an Authorization Code Client instead of an Implicit Client.
            Implicit clients are used in Javascript/Browser (SPA) based applications or native
            mobile applications with the presence of a User.
            You can read more about these clients
            [here](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/master/docs/AUTHENTICATION_README.md#implicit-flow-deprecated).
            These clients are not issued secrets or refresh tokens.

## Properties

For HTTP requests and responses, the ImplicitClient object has the following properties and JSON-serialized body: 

Property | Type | Description
 --- | --- | ---
AllowedCorsOrigins | string[] |  the values used by the default CORS policy service implementations to build a CORS policy for JavaScript clients. Maximum 10 for client.
RedirectUris | string[] |  the allowed URIs to which return tokens or authorization codes can be returned. Wildcards are ignored. URIs must match exactly what you are redirecting to after login. If URIs do not match, the authentication process will fail with a bad_client error. Maximum 10 per client.
PostLogoutRedirectUris | string[] |  allowed URIs to redirect to after logout. Wildcards are ignored. URIs must match exactly what you are redirecting to after logout. Maximum 10 for client.
ClientUri | string |  URI to a page with information about client (used on consent screen).
LogoUri | string |  URI to client logo (used on consent screen).
Id | string |  client ID for this client. This ID should be a GUID.
Name | string |  name of Client.
Enabled | bool |  whether client is enabled. Client can be used for authentication if set to true. Client cannot be used for authentication if set to false.
AccessTokenLifetime | int32 |  lifetime of access token issued for this client after authentication. Minimum 60 seconds. Maximum 3600 seconds. Defaults to 3600 seconds.
Tags | string[] |  for OSIsoft internal use only.

### Serialized model

}
```

***

## Authentication

All endpoints referenced in this documentation require authenticated access. Authorization header must be set to the access token you retrieve after a successful authentication request.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Requests made without an access token or an invalid/expired token will fail with a 401 Unauthorized response.
Requests made with an access token which does not have the correct permissions (see security subsection on every endpoint) will fail with a 403 Forbidden.
Read [here](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/master/docs/AUTHENTICATION_README.md) on how to authenticate against OCS with the various clients and receive an access token in response.

## Error handling

All responses will have an error message in the body. The exceptions are 200 responses and the 401 Unauthorized response. The error message will look as follows:

```json
{
    "OperationId": "1b2af18e-8b27-4f86-93e0-6caa3e59b90c", 
    "Error": "Error message.", 
    "Reason": "Reason that caused error.", 
    "Resolution": "Possible solution for the error." 
}
```

If and when contacting OSIsoft support about this error, please provide the OperationId.
