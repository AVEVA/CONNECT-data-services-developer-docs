# Add a role

Roles are used to manage access to assets, resources, and services. By default, the new role does not have any access granted or denied. Follow this procedure to create a role.

1. In the left pane, select **Security** > **Roles**.

1. In the toolbar, select **Add Role**.

1. Enter a **Name** for the role and, optionally, a **Description**.

1. Select **Add** to create the new role. 

   **Note:** The Role Type is Tenant Custom for all custom (or non-default) roles. 

You can now specify permissions for this role when managing permissions on assets, resources, and services.
