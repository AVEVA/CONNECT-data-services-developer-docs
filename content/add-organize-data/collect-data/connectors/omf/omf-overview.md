# OSIsoft Message Format (OMF)

You can use OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) for programmatic access to data, enabling you to integrate data collection directly into a device or asset. Because OMF does not depend on a particular binary message protocol, such as HTTP, you can use OMF to develop data-acquisition applications on platforms and in languages for which there is no native support.
OMF defines a set of message headers and bodies that enable you to generate messages for inputting data into an on-premises PI System, OSIsoft Cloud Services, or another compliant backend system.
