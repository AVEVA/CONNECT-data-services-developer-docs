# Assets API

The Assets API allows you to create, read, update, and delete assets. 

The asset feature supports the HTTP entity tag (ETag) and If-Match for conditional requests. When a `GET` call is performed, the HTTP response header includes an Etag which indicates what version of the asset resource will be retrieved.

See [Asset and AssetType Access Control API](xref:AssetOrAssetTypeAccessControlAPI), [Asset Centric Data API](xref:AssetCentricDataAPI), and [Assets Search API](xref:AssetsSearchAPI) for additional API details.

#### Example Etag Response Header
This is version 7 of this particular asset.

```
Etag: "7"
```

To edit or delete the asset, specify If-Match in the HTTP request header when calling `DELETE` or `PUT`.

#### Example If-Match Response Header
Modify or delete only if the current asset matches version 7. Otherwise, do not perform this operation. If this condition fails, return a 412. 

```
If-Match : "7"
```

Note: If-Match is optional. If you want to delete or modify an asset regardless of the asset version, do not specify an If-Match.

## `Create Asset` 
Create a new asset with a specified `Id`. 

If the asset you are trying to create references an asset type (through the AssetTypeId property) and if the corresponding asset type has a metadata value with the same `Id`, then the name and SDS type code of the metadata value on the asset must be null. If the asset type does not have metadata value with a corresponding `Id`, the name and SDS type code on the asset cannot be null.

To support flexibility on creation and update, the following rules and behaviors are executed for metadata and stream references on a given asset when that asset is created from an asset type.
## Examples

| Asset values                                             | Metadata values on the asset type                          | How references are resolved                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| Id = "Metadata Id"​ and Name = Not specified         | Id matches the asset type's Metadata Id | Uses the matching asset type's Metadata Name |
|                                                     | Id does not match any asset type Metadata Id | Id is used as Name |
| Id = Not specified​ and Name = "Metadata Name"       | Name matches asset type Metadata Name | Use matching asset type Metadata Id |
|                                                     | Name does not match any asset type Metadata Name | GUID is generated for Id |
| Id = "Metadata Id"​ and Name = "Metadata Name"       | Either Id or Name, but not both, match asset type Metadata Id or Name | Error. |

### Request 
```text 
POST api/v1-preview/Tenants/{tenantId}/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Assets/{assetId} 
```

## `Create or Update Asset` 

Create or update an asset with a specified `Id`. If the asset already exists, you can specify an If-Match property in the HTTP request header to ensure that the asset is modified only if its version matches.

To support flexibility, on creation and update, the following rules and behaviors are executed for metadata and stream references on a given asset when that asset is from an asset type.
## Examples
| Asset values                                            | Metadata values on the asset type                          | How references are resolved                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| Id = "Metadata Id"​ and Name = Not specified         | Id matches the asset type's Metadata Id | Uses the matching asset type Metadata Name |
|                                                     | Id matches the existing asset type's Metadata Id | Uses the existing matching Metadata Name|
|                                                     | Id does not match any asset type Metadata Id | Id is used as Name |
| Id = Not specified​ and Name = "Metadata Name"       | Name matches the asset type's Metadata Name | Uses the matching asset type Metadata Id |
|                                                     | Name matches the existing asset type's Metadata Name | Uses the matching existing asset type Metadata Id |
|                                                     | Name does not match any asset type Metadata Name | GUID is generated for Id |
| Id = "Metadata Id"​ and Name = "Metadata Name"       | Only Id or Name (not both) matches asset type Metadata Id or Name | Error. |
|                                                     | Only Id or Name (not both) matches existing asset type Metadata Id or Name | The non-matching Id or Name of the existing Metadata is updated |
