# View shared data in trend session

After streams are shared within a community, any [Community Member](xref:community-community-roles#community-member) can visualize those streams within the `Trend` page as if it were a data stream from their own tenant.

## To view shared data in a trend session

1. Select the applicable community and choose **Community Details**.

    The community details open. For more information about each field, see [Community details](xref:community-communities-page#community-details).

1. From the **Tenants** tab, select a tenant.

    Details for the community open in the right pane.

1. From the right pane, select the **Streams** tab.

    The **Streams** tab lists each data stream that the tenant shares with the community.

1. Select the streams that you want to view in a trend session and select **More options** ![More options](../_icons/default/dots-vertical.svg) > **Trend Streams**.

The selected streams are launched in a trend session. For more information on use of a trend session, see <xref:TrendUserInterface>.
